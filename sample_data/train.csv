"To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what Im about to tell you of practical value, let me ask you please to raise your hands. Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65, raise your hands please. Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value. The rest of you wont find my talk personally relevant, but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating. Im going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book, which compares traditional, small, tribal societies with our large, modern societies, with respect to many topics such as bringing up children, growing older, health, dealing with danger, settling disputes, religion and speaking more than one language. Those tribal societies, which constituted all human societies for most of human history, are far more diverse than are our modern, recent, big societies. All big societies that have governments, and where most people are strangers to each other, are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldnt be scorned as primitive and miserable, but also they shouldnt be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices, some of them will horrify us, but there are other tribal practices which, when we hear about them, we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves. Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years, and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly, whereas in traditional societies, older people instead live out their lives among their children, their other relatives, and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies, from much worse to much better than in our modern societies. At the worst extreme, many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways, by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die, or by abandoning them when the group moves, or by encouraging older people to commit suicide, or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents. It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic, hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who cant walk when the able bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments, such as the Arctic or deserts, where there are periodic food shortages, and occasionally there just isnt enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able bodied adults and for children. To us Americans, it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father, but what could those traditional societies do differently. They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents, and the old people know what now is going to happen to them. At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme, are the New Guinea farming societies where Ive been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years, and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies, older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children, relatives and lifelong friends. There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the societys values. First, as regards usefulness, older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren, thereby freeing up their own adult children, the parents of those grandchildren, to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools, weapons, baskets, pots and textiles. In fact, theyre usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies, and the people most knowledgeable about politics, medicine, religion, songs and dances. Finally, older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern, literate societies, where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast, in traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information. Its their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those, then, are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the societys treatment of the elderly. The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the societys cultural values. For example, theres particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia, associated with Confucius doctrine of filial piety, which means obedience, respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. Theyre at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited, for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant, or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients, American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them, even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work, so older people who are no longer working arent respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self reliance and independence, so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth, which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca Cola and beer. Just think, whats the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old. Never. Instead, the only American ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning. Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies. There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives, much better health in our old age, and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age, because older people, their children, and their friends, all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce, carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information, we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old, but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later. And conversely, we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example, as a 15 year old, I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and Im quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today, though, those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely, I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My familys first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered, an on off switch, a volume knob, and a channel selector knob. Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41 button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my 25 year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons. What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S., and to make better use of their value. Thats a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today, I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it, as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers, grandparents offer superior, motivated, experienced child care. Theyve already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren, and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers, grandparents dont quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time, older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change, but that could come back. For example, only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression, the experience of living through a world war, and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things, but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they dont come back, we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people dont. The remaining value of older people that Ill mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do, there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities, of course, decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, ambition, and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation, such as figuring out the structure of DNA, best left to scientists under the age of 30. Conversely, valuable attributes that increase with age include experience, understanding of people and human relationships, ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way, and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases, such as economics and comparative history, best left to scholars over the age of 60. Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long term plans. Ive seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, who are still active as investment managers, farmers, lawyers and doctors. In short, many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies. Paradoxically nowadays, when we have more elderly people than ever before, living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before, old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But whats true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course, Im not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small, traditional societies. To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies, and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer. Their children are more self confident, more independent, and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases, and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them. Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies. Thank you. "
"My name is Jonathan Zittrain, and in my recent work Ive been a bit of a pessimist. So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist, and give reason to hope for the future of the Internet by drawing upon its present. Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before. People are less kind. There is less trust around. I dont know. As a simple example, we could run a test here. How many people have ever hitchhiked. I know. How many people have hitchhiked within the past 10 years. Right. So what has changed. Its not better public transportation. So thats one reason to think that we might be declensionists, going in the wrong direction. But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction, and its the Internet helping it along. So example number one, the Internet itself. These are three of the founders of the Internet. They were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s. You might have had a French club or a Debate club. They had a Lets build a global network club, and it worked out very well. They are pictured here for their 25th anniversary Newsweek retrospective on the Internet. And as you can tell, they are basically goof balls. They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network. The limitation was that they didnt have any money. No particular amount of capital to invest, of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight. They had none of that. But they had an amazing freedom, which was they didnt have to make any money from it. The Internet has no business plan, never did. No CEO, no firm responsible, singly, for building it. Instead, its folks getting together to do something for fun, rather than because they were told to, or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it. That ethos led to a network architecture, a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since. So unusual, in fact, that it was said that its not clear the Internet could work. As late as 1992, IBM was known to say you couldnt possibly build a corporate network using Internet Protocol. And even some Internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out. Thats why the mascot of Internet engineering, if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee. Because the fur to wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly. And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies. Im pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding, about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly. Its very complicated, but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly. So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual. Well, to move data around from one place to another, again, its not like a package courier. Its more like a mosh pit. Imagine, you being part of a network where, youre maybe at a sporting event, and youre sitting in rows like this, and somebody asks for a beer, and it gets handed at the aisle. And your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along, at risk to your own trousers, to get it to the destination. No one pays you to do this. Its just part of your neighborly duty. And, in a way, thats exactly how packets move around the Internet, sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops, with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver. Now, of course, in a mosh pit its hard to specify a destination. You need a lot of trust, but its not like, Im trying to get to Pensacola, please. So the Internet needs addressing and directions. It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet. Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater, but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us. So what do we do to figure out who is where. We turn to the person on the right, and we tell that person what we see on our left, and vice versa. And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it, you have a general sense of where everything is. This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work. This is a system that relies on kindness and trust, which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable. In rare but striking instances, a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble. So, for example, last year, the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube. There was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked. This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the Internet. Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way. It advertised, the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet, to declare what you see near you, it advertised that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube. Thats right, it said, I am YouTube. Which meant that packets of data from subscribers going to YouTube stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there, and the ISP threw them away unopened because the point was to block it. But it didnt stop there. You see, that announcement went one click out, which got reverberated, one click out. And it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event, you have at one moment perfectly working YouTube. Then, at moment number two, you have the fake announcement go out. And within two minutes, it reverberates around and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world. If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube, your packets were going to Pakistan and they werent coming back. Now just think about that. One of the most popular websites in the world, run by the most powerful company in the world, and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it. And yet, somehow, within about two hours, the problem was fixed. How did this happen. Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG. The North American Network Operators Group, a group of people who, on a beautiful day outside, enter into a windowless room, at their terminals reading email and messages in fixed proportion font, like this, and they talk about networks. And some of them are mid level employees at Internet service providers around the world. And here is the message where one of them says, Looks like weve got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube. This is not a drill. Its not just the cluelessness of YouTube engineers. I promise. Something is up in Pakistan. And they came together to help find the problem and fix it. So its kind of like if your house catches on fire. The bad news is there is no fire brigade. The good news is random people apparate from nowhere, put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise. I was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers. You know, its just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help. And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it. Example number two. Wikipedia. If a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001 and said, Ive got a great idea. We start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything, at any time, and well get a great encyclopedia. Eh. Right. Dumbest idea ever. In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. Jimbos idea was for Nupedia. It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money because he was feeling like a good guy, and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles. The wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits, as almost an afterthought, a back room. And then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project. And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus. I am not making this up. I have a theory I can explain later. Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir fried with pimentos. But now, Wikipedia doesnt just spontaneously work. How does it really work. It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless, metaphorically speaking. And there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day, would rather be inside and monitoring this, the administrators notice board, itself a wiki page that anyone can edit. And you just bring your problems to the page. Its reminiscent of the description of history as one damn thing after another, right. Number one, Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil. Apologies, Andyvphil, if youre here today. Im not taking sides. Anon attacking me for reverting. Here is my favorite, A long story. It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. And thats what keeps Wikipedia afloat. At all times, Wikipedia is approximately 45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right. There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch. Its this thin geeky line that keeps it going. Not because its a job, not because its a career, but because its a calling. Its something they feel impelled to do because they care about it. They even gather together in such groups as the Counter Vandalism Unit, Civility, Maturity, Responsibility, to just clean up the pages. It does make you wonder if there were, for instance, a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend, who would be minding the store. So what we see, what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands, and here in South Kensington, that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else, you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function, and one in which they are more human with each other. Theyre realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do. And Wikipedia has embraced this. Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid, the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever, acting as if it were a light saber. The film, without his permission or even knowledge at first, found its way onto the Internet. Hugely viral video. Extremely popular. Totally mortifying to him. Now, it being encyclopedic and all, Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid. Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page, and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article. You could see arguments on both sides. Here is just a snapshot of some of them. They eventually decided, not unanimously by any means, not to include his real name, despite the fact that nearly all media reports did. They just didnt think it was the right thing to do. It was an act of kindness. And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page. If you do, it will be removed immediately, removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision, but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion. As a lawyer, Ive got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along. Now, this isnt just limited to Wikipedia. We see it on blogs all over the place. I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover. Wow. Blogs are going to change your business. I know they look silly. And sure they look silly. They start off on all sorts of goofy projects. This is my favorite goofy blog. Catsthatlooklikehitler dot com. You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler. Yeah, I know. Number four, its like, can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday. But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy applied to people. So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture. This one says, Bucolic meadow with split rail fence. Is that an animal carcass behind her. Youre like, You know. I think thats an animal carcass behind her. And its one after the other. But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner. Thats it. Image removed at request of owner. It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site, not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment, but just said, Hey, would you mind. The person said, No, thats fine. I believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do, to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact, and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it. I even think it can go into the real world. We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors, everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online, to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says, You know, Id rather not. And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later, this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big, if you dont mind. And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it. In the real world, we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan. And we now have means that we can build, like this system, so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it. And its no longer just a I dont know. I couldnt get there. I guess Ill move on, but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online. In fact, talk about technology imitating life imitating tech, or maybe its the other way around. An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them, and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination. It said, Can you help me get there. Released it on the streets of Manhattan. Theyll fund anything these days. Here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way, from one corner from one corner of Washington Square Park to another. That leads to example number three, hitchhiking. Im not so sure hitchhiking is dead. Why. There is the Craigslist rideshare board. If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board, tumbleweeds would be blowing through it. But its the rideshare board, and its basically the same thing. Now why are people using it. I dont know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers dont plan ahead. No. I think the actual answer is that once you reframe it, once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day, but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished, you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on Craigslist represents. And then you can highlight it into something like, yes, CouchSurfing.org. CouchSurfing, one guys idea to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a strangers couch for free, with people who live far away, and would like someone they dont know to sleep on their couch for free. Its a brilliant idea. Its a bee that, yes, flies. Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been. And if youre wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing. Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment, works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience, so there may be some selection bias there. So, my urging, my thought, is that the Internet isnt just a pile of information. Its not a noun. Its a verb. And when you go on it, if you listen and see carefully and closely enough, what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you. What its saying to you is what we heard yesterday, Demosthenes was saying to us. Its saying, Lets march. Thank you very much. "
"So in the winter of 2012, I went to visit my grandmothers house in South India, a place, by the way, where the mosquitos have a special taste for the blood of the American born. No joke. When I was there, I got an unexpected gift. It was this antique instrument made more than a century ago, hand carved from a rare wood, inlaid with pearls and with dozens of metal strings. Its a family heirloom, a link between my past, the country where my parents were born, and the future, the unknown places Ill take it. I didnt actually realize it at the time I got it, but it would later become a powerful metaphor for my work. We all know the saying, Theres no time like the present. But nowadays, it can feel like theres no time but the present. Whats immediate and ephemeral seems to dominate our lives, our economy and our politics. Its so easy to get caught up in the number of steps we took today or the latest tweet from a high profile figure. Its easy for businesses to get caught up in making immediate profits and neglect whats good for future invention. And its far too easy for governments to stand by while fisheries and farmland are depleted instead of conserved to feed future generations. I have a feeling that, at this rate, its going to be hard for our generation to be remembered as good ancestors. If you think about it, our species evolved to think ahead, to chart the stars, dream of the afterlife, sow seeds for later harvest. Some scientists call this superpower that we have mental time travel, and its responsible for pretty much everything we call human civilization, from farming to the Magna Carta to the internet, all first conjured in the minds of humans. But lets get real, if we look around us today, we dont exactly seem to be using this superpower quite enough, and that begs the question. Why not. Whats wrong is how our communities, businesses and institutions are designed. Theyre designed in a way thats impairing our foresight. I want to talk to you about the three key mistakes that I think were making. The first mistake is what we measure. When we look at the quarterly profits of a company or its near term stock price, thats often not a great measure of whether that company is going to grow its market share or be inventive in the long run. When we glue ourselves to the test scores that kids bring back from school, thats not necessarily whats great for those kids learning and curiosity in the long run. Were not measuring what really matters in the future. The second mistake were making that impairs our foresight is what we reward. When we celebrate a political leader or a business leader for the disaster she just cleaned up or the announcement she just made, were not motivating that leader to invest in preventing those disasters in the first place, or to put down payments on the future by protecting communities from floods or fighting inequality or investing in research and education. The third mistake that impairs our foresight is what we fail to imagine. Now, when we do think about the future, we tend to focus on predicting exactly whats next, whether were using horoscopes or algorithms to do that. But we spend a lot less time imagining all the possibilities the future holds. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014 in West Africa, public health officials around the world had early warning signs and predictive tools that showed how that outbreak might spread, but they failed to fathom that it would, and they failed to act in time to intervene, and the epidemic grew to kill more than 11,000 people. When people with lots of resources and good forecasts dont prepare for deadly hurricanes, theyre often failing to imagine how dangerous they can be. Now, none of these mistakes that Ive described, as dismal as they might sound, are inevitable. In fact, theyre all avoidable. What we need to make better decisions about the future are tools that can aid our foresight, tools that can help us think ahead. Think of these as something like the telescopes that ship captains of yore used when they scanned the horizon. Only instead of for looking across distance and the ocean, these tools are for looking across time to the future. I want to share with you a few of the tools that Ive found in my research that I think can help us with foresight. The first tool I want to share with you I think of as making the long game pay now. This is Wes Jackson, a farmer I spent some time with in Kansas. And Jackson knows that the way that most crops are grown around the world today is stripping the earth of the fertile topsoil we need to feed future generations. He got together with a group of scientists, and they bred perennial grain crops which have deep roots that anchor the fertile topsoil of a farm, preventing erosion and protecting future harvests. But they also knew that in order to get farmers to grow these crops in the short run, they needed to boost the annual yields of the crops and find companies willing to make cereal and beer using the grains so that farmers could reap profits today by doing whats good for tomorrow. And this is a tried and true strategy. In fact, it was used by George Washington Carver in the South of the United States after the Civil War in the early 20th century. A lot of people have probably heard of Carvers 300 uses for the peanut, the products and recipes that he came up with that made the peanut so popular. But not everyone knows why Carver did that. He was trying to help poor Alabama sharecroppers whose cotton yields were declining, and he knew that planting peanuts in their fields would replenish those soils so that their cotton yields would be better a few years later. But he also knew it needed to be lucrative for them in the short run. Alright, so lets talk about another tool for foresight. This one I like to think of as keeping the memory of the past alive to help us imagine the future. So I went to Fukushima, Japan on the sixth anniversary of the nuclear reactor disaster there that followed the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011. When I was there, I learned about the Onagawa Nuclear Power Station, which was even closer to the epicenter of that earthquake than the infamous Fukushima Daiichi that we all know about. In Onagawa, people in the city actually fled to the nuclear power plant as a place of refuge. It was that safe. It was spared by the tsunamis. It was the foresight of just one engineer, Yanosuke Hirai, that made that happen. In the 1960s, he fought to build that power plant farther back from the coast at higher elevation and with a higher sea wall. He knew the story of his hometown shrine, which had flooded in the year 869 after a tsunami. It was his knowledge of history that allowed him to imagine what others could not. OK, one more tool of foresight. This one I think of as creating shared heirlooms. These are lobster fishermen on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and theyre the ones who taught me this. They have protected their lobster harvest there for nearly a century, and theyve done that by treating it as a shared resource that theyre passing on to their collected children and grandchildren. They carefully measure what they catch so that theyre not taking the breeding lobster out of the ocean. Across North America, there are more than 30 fisheries that are doing something vaguely similar to this. Theyre creating long term stakes in the fisheries known as catch shares which get fishermen to be motivated not just in taking whatever they can from the ocean today but in its long term survival. Now there are many, many more tools of foresight I would love to share with you, and they come from all kinds of places, investment firms that look beyond near term stock prices, states that have freed their elections from the immediate interests of campaign financiers. And were going to need to marshal as many of these tools as we can if we want to rethink what we measure, change what we reward and be brave enough to imagine what lies ahead. Not all this is going to be easy, as you can imagine. Some of these tools we can pick up in our own lives, some were going to need to do in businesses or in communities, and some we need to do as a society. The future is worth this effort. My own inspiration to keep up this effort is the instrument I shared with you. Its called a dilruba, and it was custom made for my great grandfather. He was a well known music and art critic in India in the early 20th century. My great grandfather had the foresight to protect this instrument at a time when my great grandmother was pawning off all their belongings, but thats another story. He protected it by giving it to the next generation, by giving it to my grandmother, and she gave it to me. When I first heard the sound of this instrument, it haunted me. It felt like hearing a wanderer in the Himalayan fog. It felt like hearing a voice from the past. Thats my friend Simran Singh playing the dilruba. When I play it, it sounds like a cats dying somewhere, so youre welcome. This instrument is in my home today, but it doesnt actually belong to me. Its my role to shepherd it in time, and that feels more meaningful to me than just owning it for today. This instrument positions me as both a descendant and an ancestor. It makes me feel part of a story bigger than my own. And this, I believe, is the single most powerful way we can reclaim foresight, by seeing ourselves as the good ancestors we long to be, ancestors not just to our own children but to all humanity. Whatever your heirloom is, however big or small, protect it and know that its music can resonate for generations. Thank you. "
"In 2013, a team of researchers held a math test. The exam was administered to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test their ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems were two almost identical questions. Both problems used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively correct answer. The first asked about the correlation between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely to get the first question correct. But despite being mathematically identical, the results for the second question looked totally different. Here, math skills werent the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers had been tracking came into play, political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation of the data were far more likely to answer the problem right. Even the studys top mathematicians were 45 percent more likely to get the second question wrong when the correct answer challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires this kind of illogical error. Can someones political identity actually affect their ability to process information. The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible in public life, partisanship. While its often invoked in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, were strongly motivated to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self and our social communities. But this becomes a problem when the groups beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team commit a serious foul. You know thats against the rules, but your fellow fans think its totally acceptable. The tension between these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated to maintain a positive relationship with their group than perceive the world accurately. This behavior is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan based cognitive dissonance can lead people to reject evidence thats inconsistent with the party line or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies that arent grounded in truth or reason. This problem isnt new, political identities have been around for centuries. But studies show that partisan polarization has increased dramatically in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering geographically in like minded communities. Another is the growing tendency to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas from people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that youre probably more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make fact checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been presented with misinformation can also help. And when youre trying to persuade someone else, affirming their values and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence based decisions about our shared reality."
"For over 40 years, Ive been a clinical social worker and a developmental psychologist. And it seemed almost natural for me to go into the helping professions. My parents had taught me to do good for others. And so I devoted my career to working with families in some of the toughest circumstances, poverty, mental illness, immigration, refugees. And for all those years, Ive worked with hope and with optimism. In the past five years, though, my hope and my optimism have been put to the test. Ive been so deeply disappointed in the way the United States government is treating families who are coming to our southern border, asking for asylum, desperate parents with children, from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, who only want to bring their kids to safety and security. They are fleeing some of the worst violence in the world. Theyve been attacked by gangs, assaulted, raped, extorted, threatened. They have faced death. And they cant turn to their police because the police are complicit, corrupt, ineffective. Then they get to our border, and we put them in detention centers, prisons, as if they were common criminals. Back in 2014, I met some of the first children in detention centers. And I wept. I sat in my car afterwards and I cried. I was seeing some of the worst suffering Id ever known, and it went against everything I believed in my country, the rule of law and everything my parents taught me. The way the United States has handled the immigrants seeking asylum in our country over the past five years, its wrong, just simply wrong. Tonight, I want to tell you that children in immigration detention are being traumatized. And we are causing the trauma. We in America, actually, those of us here tonight, will not necessarily be on the same page with respect to immigration. Well disagree on how were going to handle all those people who want to come to our country. Frankly, it doesnt matter to me whether youre a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative. I want secure borders. I also want to keep the bad actors out. I want national security. And of course, youll have your ideas about those topics, too. But I think we can agree that America should not be doing harm. The government, the state, should not be in the business of hurting children. It should be protecting them, no matter whose children they are, your children, my grandchildren and the children of families just looking for asylum. Now, I could tell you story after story of children who have witnessed some of the worst violence in the world and are now sitting in detention. But two little boys have stayed with me over these past five years. One of them was Danny. Danny was seven and a half years old when I met him in a detention center in Karnes City, Texas, back in 2014. He was there with his mother and his brother, and they had fled Honduras. You know, Danny is one of these kids that you get to love instantly. Hes funny, hes innocent, hes charming and very expressive. And hes drawing pictures for me, and one of the pictures he drew for me was of the Revos Locos. this is the name that they gave to gangs in the town that he was in. I said to Danny, Danny, what makes them bad guys. Danny looked at me with puzzlement. I mean, the look was more like, Are you clueless or just stupid. He leaned in and he whispered, Dont you see. They smoke cigarettes. And they drink beer. Danny had learned, of course, about the evils of drinking and smoking. Then he said, And they carry guns. In one of the pictures, the stick figures of the Revos Locos are shooting at birds and at people. Danny told me about the day his uncle was killed by those Revos Locos and how he ran from his house to his uncles farmhouse, only to see his uncles dead body, his face disfigured by bullets. And Danny told me he saw his uncles teeth coming out the back of his head. He was only six at the time. Sometime after that, one of those Revos Locos beat little Danny badly, severely, and thats when his parents said, We have got to leave or they will kill us. So they set out. But Dannys father was a single leg amputee with a crutch, and he couldnt manage the rugged terrain. So he said to his wife, Go without me. Take our boys. Save our boys. So Mom and the boys set off. Danny told me he looked back, said goodbye to his father, looked back a couple of times until he lost sight of his father. In detention, he had not heard from his father. And its very likely that his father was killed by the Revos Locos, because he had tried to flee. I cant forget Danny. The other boy was Fernando. Now, Fernando was in the same detention center, roughly the same age as Danny. Fernando was telling me about the 24 hours he spent in isolation with his mother in the detention center, placed there because his mother had led a hunger strike among the mothers in the detention center, and now she was cracking under the pressure of the guards, who were threatening and being very abusive towards her and Fernando. As Fernando and I are talking in the small office, his mother burst in, and she says, They hear you. Theyre listening to you. And she dropped to her hands and knees, and she began to look under the table, groping under all the chairs. She looked at the electric sockets, at the corner of the room, the floor, the corner of the ceiling, at the lamp, at the air vent, looking for hidden microphones and cameras. I watched Fernando as he watched his mother spiral into this paranoid state. I looked in his eyes and I saw utter terror. After all, who would take care of him if she couldnt. It was just the two of them. They only had each other. I could tell you story after story, but I havent forgotten Fernando. And I know something about what that kind of trauma, stress and adversity does to children. So Im going to get clinical with you for a moment, and Im going to be the professor that I am. Under prolonged and intense stress, trauma, hardship, adversity, harsh conditions, the developing brain is harmed, plain and simple. Its wiring and its architecture are damaged. The childs natural stress response system is affected. Its weakened of its protective factors. Regions of the brain that are associated with cognition, intellectual abilities, judgment, trust, self regulation, social interaction, are weakened, sometimes permanently. That impairs childrens future. We also know that under stress, the childs immune system is suppressed, making them susceptible to infections. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, will follow those children into adulthood and likely shorten their lives. Mental health problems are linked to the breakdown of the body. I have seen children in detention who have recurrent and disturbing nightmares, night terrors, depression and anxiety, dissociative reactions, hopelessness, suicidal thinking and post traumatic stress disorders. And they regress in their behavior, like the 11 year old boy who began to wet his bed again after years of continence. And the eight year old girl who was buckling under the pressure and was insisting that her mother breastfeed her. That is what detention does to children. Now, you may ask. What do we do. What should our government do. Well, Im just a mental health professional, so all I really know is about childrens health and development. But I have some ideas. First, we need to reframe our practices. We need to replace fear and hostility with safety and compassion. We need to tear down the prison walls, the barbed wire, take away the cages. Instead of prison, or prisons, we should create orderly asylum processing centers, campus like communities where children and families can live together. We could take old motels, old army barracks, refit them so that children and parents can live as family units in some safety and normality, where kids can run around. In these processing centers, pediatricians, family doctors, dentists and nurses, would be screening, examining, treating and immunizing children, creating records that will follow them to their next medical provider. Social workers would be conducting mental health evaluations and providing treatment for those who need it. Those social workers would be connecting families to services that theyre going to need, wherever theyre headed. And teachers would be teaching and testing children and documenting their learning so that the teachers at the next school can continue those childrens education. Theres a lot more that we could do in these processing centers. A lot more. And you probably are thinking, this is pie in the sky stuff. Cant blame you. Well, let me tell you that refugee camps all over the world are holding families like those in our detention centers, and some of those refugee camps are getting it right far better than we are. The United Nations has issued reports describing refugee camps that protect childrens health and development. Children and parents live in family units and clusters of families are housed together. Parents are given work permits so they can earn some money, theyre given food vouchers so they can go to the local stores and shop. Mothers are brought together to cook healthy meals for the children, and children go to school every day and are taught. Afterwards, after school, they go home and they ride bikes, hang out with friends, do homework and explore the world, all the essentials for child development. We can get it right. We have the resources to get it right. What we need is the will and the insistence of Americans that we treat children humanely. You know, I cant forget Danny or Fernando. I wonder where they are today, and I pray that they are healthy and happy. They are only two of the many children I met and of the thousands we know about who have been in detention. I may be saddened by whats happened to the children, but Im inspired by them. I may cry, as I did, but I admire those childrens strength. They keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do. So while we may differ on our approach to immigration, we should be treating children with dignity and respect. We should do right by them. If we do, we can prepare those children who remain in the United States, prepare them to become productive, engaged members of our society. And those who will return to their countries whether voluntarily or not will be prepared to become the teachers, the merchants, the leaders in their country. And I hope together all of those children and parents could give testimony to the world about the goodness of our country and our values. But we have to get it right. So we can agree to disagree on immigration, but I hope we can agree on one thing, that none of us wants to look back at this moment in our history, when we knew we were inflicting lifelong trauma on children, and that we sat back and did nothing. That would be the greatest tragedy of all. Thank you. "
"In my early days as a graduate student, I went on a snorkeling trip off the coast of the Bahamas. Id actually never swum in the ocean before, so it was a bit terrifying. What I remember the most is, as I put my head in the water and I was trying really hard to breathe through the snorkel, this huge group of striped yellow and black fish came straight at me ... and I just froze. And then, as if it had suddenly changed its mind, came towards me and then swerved to the right and went right around me. It was absolutely mesmerizing. Maybe many of you have had this experience. Of course, theres the color and the beauty of it, but there was also just the sheer oneness of it, as if it wasnt hundreds of fish but a single entity with a single collective mind that was making decisions. When I look back, I think that experience really ended up determining what Ive worked on for most of my career. Im a computer scientist, and the field that I work in is artificial intelligence. And a key theme in AI is being able to understand intelligence by creating our own computational systems that display intelligence the way we see it in nature. Now, most popular views of AI, of course, come from science fiction and the movies, and Im personally a big Star Wars fan. But that tends to be a very human centric view of intelligence. When you think of a fish school, or when I think of a flock of starlings, that feels like a really different kind of intelligence. For starters, any one fish is just so tiny compared to the sheer size of the collective, so it seems that any one individual would have a really limited and myopic view of whats going on, and intelligence isnt really about the individual but somehow a property of the group itself. Secondly, and the thing that I still find most remarkable, is that we know that there are no leaders supervising this fish school. Instead, this incredible collective mind behavior is emerging purely from the interactions of one fish and another. Somehow, there are these interactions or rules of engagement between neighboring fish that make it all work out. So the question for AI then becomes, what are those rules of engagement that lead to this kind of intelligence, and of course, can we create our own. And thats the primary thing that I work on with my team in my lab. We work on it through theory, looking at abstract rule systems and thinking about the mathematics behind it. We also do it through biology, working closely with experimentalists. But mostly, we do it through robotics, where we try to create our own collective systems that can do the kinds of things that we see in nature, or at least try to. One of our first robotic quests along this line was to create our very own colony of a thousand robots. So very simple robots, but they could be programmed to exhibit collective intelligence, and thats what we were able to do. So this is what a single robot looks like. Its quite small, about the size of a quarter, and you can program how it moves, but it can also wirelessly communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them. And so now we can start to program exactly an interaction, a rule of engagement between neighbors. And once we have this system, we can start to program many different kinds of rules of engagement that you would see in nature. So for example, spontaneous synchronization, how audiences are clapping and suddenly start all clapping together, the fireflies flashing together. We can program rules for pattern formation, how cells in a tissue determine what role theyre going to take on and set the patterns of our bodies. We can program rules for migration, and in this way, were really learning from natures rules. But we can also take it a step further. We can actually take these rules that weve learned from nature and combine them and create entirely new collective behaviors of our very own. So for example, imagine that you had two different kinds of rules. So your first rule is a motion rule where a moving robot can move around other stationary robots. And your second rule is a pattern rule where a robot takes on a color based on its two nearest neighbors. So if I start with a blob of robots in a little pattern seed, it turns out that these two rules are sufficient for the group to be able to self assemble a simple line pattern. And if I have more complicated pattern rules, and I design error correction rules, we can actually create really, really complicated self assemblies, and heres what that looks like. So here, youre going to see a thousand robots that are working together to self assemble the letter K. The K is on its side. And the important thing is that no one is in charge. So any single robot is only talking to a small number of robots nearby it, and its using its motion rule to move around the half built structure just looking for a place to fit in based on its pattern rules. And even though no robot is doing anything perfectly, the rules are such that we can get the collective to do its goal robustly together. And the illusion becomes almost so perfect, you know, you just start to not even notice that theyre individual robots at all, and it becomes a single entity, kind of like the school of fish. So these are robots and rules in two dimensions, but we can also think about robots and rules in three dimensions. So what if we could create robots that could build together. And here, we can take inspiration from social insects. So if you think about mound building termites or you think about army ants, they create incredible, complex nest structures out of mud and even out of their own bodies. And like the system I showed you before, these insects actually also have pattern rules that help them determine what to build, but the pattern can be made out of other insects, or it could be made out of mud. And we can use that same idea to create rules for robots. So here, youre going to see some simulated robots. So the simulated robot has a motion rule, which is how it traverses through the structure, looking for a place to fit in, and it has pattern rules where it looks at groups of blocks to decide whether to place a block. And with the right motion rules and the right pattern rules, we can actually get the robots to build whatever we want. And of course, everybody wants their own tower. So once we have these rules, we can start to create the robot bodies that go with these rules. So here, you see a robot that can climb over blocks, but it can also lift and move these blocks and it can start to edit the very structure that its on. But with these rules, this is really only one kind of robot body that you could imagine. You could imagine many different kinds of robot bodies. So if you think about robots that maybe could move sandbags and could help build levees, or we could think of robots that built out of soft materials and worked together to shore up a collapsed building, so just the same kind of rules in different kinds of bodies. Or if, like my group, you are completely obsessed with army ants, then maybe one day we can make robots that can climb over literally anything including other members of their tribe, and self assemble things out of their own bodies. Once you understand the rules, just many different kinds of robot visions become possible. And coming back to the snorkeling trip, we actually understand a great deal about the rules that fish schools use. So if we can invent the bodies to go with that, then maybe there is a future where I and my group will get to snorkel with a fish school of our own creation. Each of these systems that I showed you brings us closer to having the mathematical and the conceptual tools to create our own versions of collective power, and this can enable many different kinds of future applications, whether you think about robots that build flood barriers or you think about robotic bee colonies that could pollinate crops or underwater schools of robots that monitor coral reefs, or if we reach for the stars and we thinking about programming constellations of satellites. In each of these systems, being able to understand how to design the rules of engagement and being able to create good collective behavior becomes a key to realizing these visions. So, so far Ive talked about rules for insects and for fish and for robots, but what about the rules that apply to our own human collective. And the last thought that Id like to leave you with is that science is of course itself an incredible manifestation of collective intelligence, but unlike the beautiful fish schools that I study, I feel we still have a much longer evolutionary path to walk. So in addition to working on improving the science of robot collectives, I also work on creating robots and thinking about rules that will improve our own scientific collective. Theres this saying that I love, who does science determines what science gets done. Imagine a society where we had rules of engagement where every child grew up believing that they could stand here and be a technologist of the future, or where every adult believed that they had the ability not just to understand but to change how science and technology impacts their everyday lives. What would that society look like. I believe that we can do that. I believe that we can choose our rules, and we engineer not just robots but we can engineer our own human collective, and if we do and when we do, it will be beautiful. Thank you. "
"Today Im going to talk to you about the problem of other minds. And the problem Im going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy, which is, How can we know whether other people have minds. That is, maybe you have a mind, and everyone else is just a really convincing robot. So thats a problem in philosophy, but for todays purposes Im going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I dont have to worry about this. There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists, which is, Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes. Or perhaps, more relevantly, Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes. I think novelists put this best. Like Philip Roth, who said, And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people. So ill equipped are we all, to envision one anothers interior workings and invisible aims. So as a teacher and as a spouse, this is, of course, a problem I confront every day. But as a scientist, Im interested in a different problem of other minds, and that is the one Im going to introduce to you today. And that problem is, How is it so easy to know other minds. So to start with an illustration, you need almost no information, one snapshot of a stranger, to guess what this woman is thinking, or what this man is. And put another way, the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds, our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells, that we share with all other animals, with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs. And yet, you put them together in a particular network, and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet. Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but Im not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant. So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas, one in each hand. And to try to understand how you can put together simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network, and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds. So Im going to tell you three things about this today. Obviously the whole project here is huge. And Im going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other peoples thoughts. Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job. And then finally, to show that some of the differences between people, in how we judge others, can be explained by differences in this brain system. So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other peoples thoughts. This is a picture of it. Its called the Right Temporo Parietal Junction. Its above and behind your right ear. And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you, or when you read Romeo and Juliet or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan. And you dont use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems. So this brain region is called the Right TPJ. And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults. Theyre MIT undergraduates. The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we werent always that way. It takes children a long time to break into the system. Im going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process. The first thing Im going to show you is a change between age three and five, as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own. So Im going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task. Rebecca Saxe , This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan. And you know what pirates really like. Child. What. Pirates really like cheese sandwiches. Child. Cheese. I love cheese. Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich, and he says, Yum yum yum yum yum. I really love cheese sandwiches. And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest. And Ivan says, You know what. I need a drink with my lunch. And so Ivan goes to get a drink. And while Ivan is away the wind comes, and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass. And now, here comes the other pirate. This pirate is called Joshua. And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches. So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says, Yum yum yum yum yum. I love cheese sandwiches. And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest. Child. So, that one is his. That one is Joshuas. Thats right. Child. And then his went on the ground. Thats exactly right. Child. So he wont know which one is his. Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink. Ivan comes back and he says, I want my cheese sandwich. So which one do you think Ivan is going to take. Child. I think he is going to take that one. Yeah, you think hes going to take that one. All right. Lets see. Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one. So thats a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions. Now Im going to show you a three year old who got the same puzzle. And Ivan says, I want my cheese sandwich. Which sandwich is he going to take. Do you think hes going to take that one. Lets see what happens. Lets see what he does. Here comes Ivan. And he says, I want my cheese sandwich. And he takes this one. Uh oh. Why did he take that one. Child. His was on the grass. So the three year old does two things differently. First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich thats really his. And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say hes taking that one because he thinks its his, the three year old comes up with another explanation. Hes not taking his own sandwich because he doesnt want it, because now its dirty, on the ground. So thats why hes taking the other sandwich. Now of course, development doesnt end at five. And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other peoples thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now, not for an action prediction, but for a moral judgment. So first Im going to show you the three year old again. RS., So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. Yeah. Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. Yeah. So its maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshuas sandwich, since he thinks Ivan only took Joshuas sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich. But now Im going to show you the five year old. Remember the five year old completely understood why Ivan took Joshuas sandwich. Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. Um, yeah. And so, it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response. Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. No, because the wind should get in trouble. He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches. And now what weve started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask whats going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other peoples thoughts. So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ, being used while children are thinking about other people. But its not quite like the adult brain. So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized, it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other peoples thoughts, in children its much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you. And actually if we even look at eight to 11 year olds, getting into early adolescence, they still dont have quite an adult like brain region. And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence, both the cognitive system, our minds ability to think about other minds, and the brain system that supports it are continuing, slowly, to develop. But of course, as youre probably aware, even in adulthood, people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds, how often they do it and how accurately. And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults in how they think about other peoples thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region. So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids. And Im going to give that to you now. So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory, and they take a break for coffee. And Graces friend asks for some sugar in her coffee. Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder, which is sugar. But the powder is labeled Deadly Poison, so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison. And she puts it in her friends coffee. And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine. How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee. Okay. Good. So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm. And we can compare that to another case, where everything in the real world is the same. The powder is still sugar, but whats different is what Grace thinks. Now she thinks the powder is sugar. And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friends coffee, people say she deserves no blame at all. Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though its really sugar, now people say she deserves a lot of blame, even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. And in fact, they say she deserves more blame in this case, the failed attempt to harm, than in another case, which we call an accident. Where Grace thought the powder was sugar, because it was labeled sugar and by the coffee machine, but actually the powder was poison. So even though when the powder was poison, the friend drank the coffee and died, people say Grace deserves less blame in that case, when she innocently thought it was sugar, than in the other case, where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred. People, though, disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case. Some people think she should deserve more blame, and other people less. And what Im going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while theyre making that judgment. So what Im showing you, from left to right, is how much activity there was in this brain region, and from top to bottom, how much blame people said that Grace deserved. And what you can see is, on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region, people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident. Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity, people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief, and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident. So thats good, but of course what wed rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change peoples moral judgment. And we do have such a tool. Its called Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS. This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebodys skull, into a small region of their brain, and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region. So Im going to show you a demo of this. First, Im going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse. Im going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine. When you hear clicks, were turning the machine on. So now Im going to apply that same pulse to my brain, to the part of my brain that controls my hand. So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse. Woman , Ready, Rebecca. Yes. Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain. And we can use that same pulse, now applied to the RTPJ, to ask if we can change peoples moral judgments. So these are the judgments I showed you before, peoples normal moral judgments. And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how peoples judgments change. And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall. So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same. They say she deserves no blame. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar, but it was really poison and so she caused a death, people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame. So what Ive told you today is that people come, actually, especially well equipped to think about other peoples thoughts. We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking. This system takes a long time to develop, slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence. And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people. But I want to give the last word back to the novelists, and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying, The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. Its getting them wrong that is living. Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong, and then on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. Thank you. So, I have a question. When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change peoples moral judgments, that sounds alarming. Please tell me that youre not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say. Im not. I mean, theyre calling, but Im not taking the call. They really are calling. So then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. I mean, youre clearly an incredible human being, but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber, do acts that people here might be worried about. Yeah, we worry about this. So, theres a couple of things to say about TMS. One is that you cant be TMSed without knowing it. So its not a surreptitious technology. Its quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes. The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain, but theyre small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make. And what we changed was not peoples moral judgments when theyre deciding what to do, when theyre making action choices. We changed their ability to judge other peoples actions. And so, I think of what Im doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial, but studying the jury. Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education, to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments. Thats one of the idealistic hopes. The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. Until recently, what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animals brain could do too, so we could study it in animal models. We knew how brains see, and how they control the body and how they hear and sense. And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things, learn language and abstract concepts, and thinking about other peoples thoughts, thats brand new. And we dont know yet what the implications will be of understanding it. So Ive got one last question. There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness, that puzzles a lot of people. The notion that you can understand why a brain works, perhaps. But why does anyone have to feel anything. Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate. Youre a brilliant young neuroscientist. I mean, what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career, someone, you or someone else, is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem. I hope they do. And I think they probably wont. Why. Its not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing. Thats a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic. "
"Hi. Im Kevin Allocca, Im the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. Its true. So were going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. We all want to be stars, celebrities, singers, comedians, and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do. But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our worlds culture. Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday. But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. So how does it happen. Three things, tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness. All right, lets go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wooo. Ohhhhh, wowwww. Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer. But he didnt actually set out to make a viral video, Bear. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because thats what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January. So what happened here. Jimmy Kimmel actually. Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience. Its Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. Everybodys looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. Gettin down on Friday. So you didnt think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope. Rebecca Blacks Friday is one of the most popular videos of the year. Its been seen nearly 200 million times this year. This is a chart of what it looked like. And similar to Double Rainbow, it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. So what happened on this day. Well it was a Friday, this is true. And if youre wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays. But what about this day, this one particular Friday. Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about. Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. But whats important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process. And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. And now there are 10,000 parodies of Friday on YouTube. Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week. Unlike the one way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon, either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. So Nyan Cat is a looped animation with looped music. Its this, just like this. Its been viewed nearly 50 million times this year. And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three hour version of this thats been viewed four million times. Even cats were watching this video. Cats were watching other cats watch this video. But whats important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture. There were remixes. Someone made an old timey version. And then it went international. An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of. Because we dont just enjoy now, we participate. And who could have predicted any of this. Who could have predicted Double Rainbow or Rebecca Black or Nyan Cat. What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it. In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasnt very interested. So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times. And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively. And so it all brings us to one big question ... What does this mean. Ohhhh. What does it mean. Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity. I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube. No one has to green light your idea. And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. And these are not characteristics of old media, and theyre barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future. Thank you. "
"I want to talk to you about, or share with you, a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse. Were talking about a pick, pack and ship setting here. So as a hint, this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots, sometimes thousands of mobile robots, moving around a warehouse. And Ill get to the solution. But for a moment, just think about the last time that you ordered something online. You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt. So, click., you put it into your shopping cart. And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too, click. And maybe a blue pair of shoes, click. So at this point youve assembled your order. You didnt stop to think for a moment that that might not be a great outfit. But you hit submit order. And two days later, this package shows up on your doorstep. And you open the box and youre like, wow, theres my goo. Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse. So Im here to tell you its that guy right there. So deep in the middle of that picture, you see a classic pick pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. Classically these pick workers will spend 60 or 70 percent of their day wandering around the warehouse. Theyll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles in pursuit of those items of inventory. Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders, it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders. So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem. I was out in the Bay area in 99, 2000, the dot com boom. I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called Webvan. This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. And it really came down to the fact that we couldnt do it cost effectively. Turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly. In this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory into a few totes, onto a van to deliver to the home. And when you think about it, it was costing us 30 dollars. Imagine, we had an 89 can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote. And thats before we actually tried to deliver it to the home. So long story short, during my one year at Webvan, what I realized by talking to all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking. Red item, green, blue, getting those three things in a box. So we said, theres just got to be a better way to do this. Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores. Of course Webvan went out of business, and about a year and a half later, I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me. And I started thinking about it again. And I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker, or my vision for how it should work. I said, lets focus on the problem. I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red, green and blue in this box right here. What I need is a system where I put out my hand and, poof., the product shows up and I pack it into the order, and now were thinking, this would be a very operator centric approach to solving the problem. This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem. But as you can see, orders can come and go, products can come and go. It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem, and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible. So how did I arrive at this notion. Well, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise, probably a technique that many of you use, Its this notion of testing your ideas. Take a blank sheet, of course, but then test your ideas at the limits, infinity, zero. In this particular case, we challenged ourselves with the idea. What if we had to build a distribution center in China, where its a very, very low cost market. And say, labor is cheap, land is cheap. And we said specifically, What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million square foot distribution center. So naturally that led to ideas that said, Lets put lots of people in the warehouse. And I said, Hold on, zero dollars per hour, what I would do is hire 10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m., walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. So you hold Captain Crunch, you hold the Mountain Dew, you hold the Diet Coke. If I need it, Ill call you, otherwise just stand there. But when I need Diet Coke and I call it, you guys talk amongst yourselves. Diet Coke walks up to the front, pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes. Wow, what if the products could walk and talk on their own. Thats a very interesting, very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse. So of course, labor isnt free, on that practical versus awesome spectrum. So we said mobile shelving, Well put them on mobile shelving. Well use mobile robots and well move the inventory around. And so we got underway on that and then Im sitting on my couch in 2008. Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies. I about fell out of my couch when I saw this. Im like, that was the idea. Well put thousands of people on the warehouse floor, the stadium floor. But interestingly enough, this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful, impressive digital art, all without computers, Im told, it was all peer to peer coordination and communication. You stand up, Ill squat down. And they made some fabulous art. It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other. So that was a little bit of the journey. So of course, now what became the practical reality of this idea. Here is a warehouse. Its a pick, pack and ship center that has about 10,000 different SKUs. Well call them red pens, green pens, yellow Post It Notes. We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods. And we deliver them to the side of the building. So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter. And the game here is to pick up the shelves, take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker. This pick workers life is completely different. Rather than wandering around the warehouse, she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her. So the process is very productive. Reach in, pick an item, scan the bar code, pack it out. By the time you turn around, theres another product there ready to be picked and packed. So what weve done is take out all of the non value added walking, searching, wasting, waited time, and weve developed a very high fidelity way to pick these orders, where you point at it with a laser, scan the UPC barcode, and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into. So more productive, more accurate and, it turns out, its a more interesting office environment for these pick workers. They actually complete the whole order. So they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order. And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment. So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us. We knew it was going to be more productive. But we didnt realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine. So this is again a cross fertilization of ideas. Heres a warehouse and were thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures. The notion here is that you have 10 workers on the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers. If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom, it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers. Contrast that, for a moment, with the traditional method of using a conveyor. When one person passes the order to you, you put something in and pass it downstream. Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work. This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse. And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that were tracking the popularity of the products. And were using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse. So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentines Day. All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations. Come in two days after Valentines Day, and that candy, the leftover candy, has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there. One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous. So whether youre doing two pick stations, 20 pick stations, or 200 pick stations, the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work. In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because thats where the pick stations were. They sorted it out for themselves. So Ill conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick workers actual day in the life of. So as we mentioned, the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations. And our software in the background understands whats going on in each station, we direct the pods across the highway and were attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker. Whats interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers. The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few. But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before. She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it. Or she has to reach in and get it. She scans it and she puts it in the bucket. And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes. So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job. Never has any idle time, never has to leave her mat. And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders. We think its a more fulfilling way to fill orders. The reason we can say that, though, is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. And sometimes well catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as, they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren, or in one case a guy said, the Kiva zone is so stress free that Ive actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication. That was at a pharmaceutical distributor, so they told us not to use that video. So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own, interesting processes and productivities can emerge. And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online, you break it open and the goo is in there, youll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. Thank you. "
"As an Indian, and now as a politician and a government minister, Ive become rather concerned about the hype were hearing about our own country, all this talk about India becoming a world leader, even the next superpower. In fact, the American publishers of my book, The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone, added a gratuitous subtitle saying, India. The next 21st century power. And I just dont think thats what Indias all about, or should be all about. Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. Its redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all, what constitutes a world leader. If its population, were on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by 2034. Is it military strength. Well, we have the worlds fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity. We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it, in an agreement. Is it the economy. Well, we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year, we grew at 6.7 percent. But, somehow, none of that adds up to me, to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world, in this part of the 21st century. And so I wondered, could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else, the power of example, the attraction of Indias culture, what, in other words, people like to call soft power. Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic, Joseph Nye, a friend of mine. And, very simply, and Im really cutting it short because of the time limits here, its essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, its political values, its foreign policies. And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States, but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power, the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But, the fact is, in fact, that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity. So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today, what we might call the TED age, Id say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public thats been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news, of televised images, of cellphone videos, of email gossip. In other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. Now, in this age, again, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how theyre seen. India has more all news TV channels than any country in the world, in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. But, the fact still is that its not just that. In order to have soft power, you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think youve already heard the figures. Weve been selling 15 million cellphones a month. Currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands, in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact, those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country, including the U.S. and China, has ever established in the history of telecommunications. But, what perhaps some of you dont realize is how far weve come to get there. You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rarity. In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there. I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces, there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number, the odds were two in three you wouldnt get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words wrong number were more popular than the word Hello. If you then wanted to connect to another city, lets say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi, youd have to book something called a trunk call, and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days, so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. In fact, so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this. And the Then Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasnt satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in India. Now, fast forward to today and this is what you see, the 15 million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi, on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century, wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century. Hes called an isthri wala. But hes carrying a 21st century instrument. Hes carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free, and thats how he gets orders from the neighborhood, to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend, about 20 kilometers away from any place youd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said, Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water. And its the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number, and a voice said, Im up here. And right on top of the nearest coconut tree, with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other, was a local toddy tapper, who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open, if the market was on, whether the product theyd harvested could be sold, what price theyd fetch. Theyd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back, then theyd load the cart. Today theyre saving half a days labor with a two minute phone call. So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But, of course thats not the only thing about India thats spreading. Youve got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump, Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me, and theyre chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat, chewing away, says, You know, this film is not bad. And the second goat says, No, the book was better. I usually tend to think that the book is usually better, but, having said that, the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian ness and Indian culture around the globe, not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K., but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians. Ive met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar, just to watch a Bollywood movie. She cant understand the dialogue. Shes illiterate, so she cant read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps, and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result. And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesnt have a military mission there. You know what was Indias biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years. One simple fact, you couldnt try to call an Afghan at 8 30 in the evening. Why. Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at 8 30. Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set, and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at 8 30. I have read a Reuters dispatch, so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency, about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers, its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors, any moving part they could find, at 8 30, because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the shows heroine, Tulsi Zindabad, Long live Tulsi. Thats soft power. And that is what India is developing through the E part of its own entertainment industry. The same is true, of course, we dont have time for too many more examples, but its true of our music, of our dance, of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine. I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid 70s, and what I see today, you cant go to a mid size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But, today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining, ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. But, with this increasing awareness of India, with yoga and ayurveda, and so on, with tales like Afghanistan, comes something vital in the information era, the sense that in todays world its not the side of the bigger army that wins, its the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid 70s, I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all. Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend, a history major like me, who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, by an anxiously perspiring European saying, Youre Indian, youre Indian. Can you help me fix my laptop. Weve gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails, and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick, to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But, there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. Its a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans. In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas, landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state, somewhere around 52 A.D., he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism. Thats the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south, slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections, the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year. But, the fact is that the last elections, five years ago, gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi, who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh, to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam, in a country 81 percent Hindu. This is India, and of course its all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world, more than 220 years of free and fair elections, which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasnt white, male or Christian. So, maybe, oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon, and he is male, but he isnt white. All the others have been all those three. All his predecessors have been all those three, and thats the point I was trying to make. But, the issue is that when I talked about that example, its not just about talking about India, its not propaganda. Because ultimately, that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately, it seems to me, that always works better than propaganda. Governments arent very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is, and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately will make a difference in todays information era, in todays TED age. So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion, because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically, weve every religion know to mankind, with the possible exception of Shintoism, though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations. Weve got all of that. We dont even have geography uniting us, because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947. In fact, you cant even take the name of the country for granted, because the name India comes from the river Indus, which flows in Pakistan. But, the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. Its the idea of an ever ever land, emerging from an ancient civilization, united by a shared history, but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy. That is a 21st century story as well as an ancient one. And its the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter, and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle, that in a diverse plural democracy like India you dont really have to agree on everything all the time, so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India, a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate, in the 50s and 60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India, it isnt military muscle, economic power. All of that is necessary, but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power. We cant really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development, the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school, and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. But, its all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges, those real challenges which none of us can pretend dont exist. But, its all taking place in an open society, in a rich and diverse and plural civilization, in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. Thats why India belongs at TED, and thats why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much. "
"The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives, amazing people. And thats what its about. We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but thats it. And so Im not going to talk about the painted portrait today. Im going to talk about a program I started there, which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did. I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people dont get their portraits painted anymore, and theyre amazing people, and we want to deliver them to future generations. So, how do we do that. And so I came up with the idea of the living self portrait series. And the living self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview. And so what Im going to do is, not so much give you the great hits of that program, as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation, what you try to find out about them, and when people deliver and when they dont and why. Now, I had two preconditions. One was that they be American. Thats just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery, its created to look at American lives. That was easy, but then I made the decision, maybe arbitrary, that they needed to be people of a certain age, which at that point, when I created this program, seemed really old. Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties. For obvious reasons, it doesnt seem that old anymore to me. And why did I do that. Well, for one thing, were a youth obsessed culture. And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. But the second part of it, and the older I get, the more convinced I am that thats true. Its amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out. Thats the one advantage that older people have. Well, they have other, little bit of advantage, but they also have some disadvantages, but the one thing they or we have is that weve reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. So, we can then go back in our lives, if weve got an interviewer who gets that, and begin to reflect on how we got there. All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited. So, I thought okay, now, what is it going to take to make this work. There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. There are the journalist interviews, which are the interrogation that is expected. This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. Then theres the celebrity interview, where its more important whos asking the question than who answers. Thats Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that. Thats Frost Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process. Fair enough. But I wanted interviews that were different. I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic, which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self revelation. By the way, this was always done in public. This was not an oral history program. This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual, and having me be the brush in their self portrait. Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that. I didnt know it coming into it. And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright, and that was six months after hed had a stroke. And he had never appeared in public since that point. This was not a devastating stroke, but it did affect his speaking and so forth. And I thought it was worth a chance, he thought it was worth a chance, and so we got up on the stage, and we had an hour conversation about his life, and after that a woman rushed up to me, essentially did, and she said, Where did you train as a doctor. And I said, I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that. And she said, Well, something very weird was happening. When he started a sentence, particularly in the early parts of the interview, and paused, you gave him the word, the bridge to get to the end of the sentence, and by the end of it, he was speaking complete sentences on his own. I didnt know what was going on, but I was so part of the process of getting that out. So I thought, okay, fine, Ive got empathy, or empathy, at any rate, is whats critical to this kind of interview. But then I began to think of other things. Who makes a great interview in this context. It had nothing to do with their intellect, the quality of their intellect. Some of them were very brilliant, some of them were, you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals, but it was never about that. It was about their energy. Its energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives. Im convinced of it. And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young. These were people through their 90s. In fact, the first person I interviewed was George Abbott, who was 97, and Abbott was filled with the life force, I guess thats the way I think about it, filled with it. And so he filled the room, and we had an extraordinary conversation. He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent, for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. And, in fact, he did wind up opening up, by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways. He subsequently got married again at 102, so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him. But after the interview, I got a call, very gruff voice, from a woman. I didnt know who she was, and she said, Did you get George Abbott to talk. And I said, Yeah. Apparently I did. And she said, Im his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton, and I could never do it. And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk. So, you know, you want energy, you want the life force, but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. Never ever get up on a stage with somebody whos modest, because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them, and they sit there and they say, Aw, shucks, it was an accident. Theres nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them. The worst interview I ever did. William L. Shirer. The journalist who did The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months, and every time Id ask him about it, hed say, Oh, I just happened to be there. Didnt matter. Whatever. Awful. I never would ever agree to interview a modest person. They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you. But it comes down, in the end, to how do you get through all the barriers we have. All of us are public and private beings, and if all youre going to get from the interviewee is their public self, theres no point in it. Its preprogrammed. Its infomercial, and we all have infomercials about our lives. We know the great lines, we know the great moments, we know what were not going to share, and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. This wasnt, and some of you will remember Mike Wallaces old interviews, tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place. I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say, to break out of their own cocoon of the public self, and the more public they had been, the more entrenched that person, that outer person was. And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series. It all has to do with that shell that most of us have, and particularly certain people. Theres an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce. Itll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you. She did so much. She was a playwright. She did an extraordinary play called The Women. She was a congresswoman when there werent very many congresswomen. She was editor of Vanity Fair, one of the great phenomenal women of her day. And, incidentally, I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right. She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left. And, in fact, when we did the interview, I did the living self portrait with her, there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet, just enjoying her presence. And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake, because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes. We never talk before that because if you talk before, you dont get it on the stage. So she and I had a delightful conversation. We were on the stage and then, by the way, spectacular. It was all part of Clare Boothe Luces look. She was in a great evening gown. She was 80, almost that day of the interview, and there she was and there I was, and I just proceeded into the questions. And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss, and I was basically up there, any of you in the moderate to full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage. And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing. And I began to wonder what was going on, and you think while you talk, and basically, I thought, I got it. When we were alone, I was her audience. Now Im her competitor for the audience. Thats the problem here, and shes fighting me for that, and so then I asked her a question, I didnt know how I was going to get out of it, I asked her a question about her days as a playwright, and again, characteristically, instead of saying, Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah, she said, Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright. Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress. But I hadnt asked that, and then she went off on a tear, and she said, Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress. It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman, and I got up there, and she went on and on, And then I got on the stage. And then she turned to me and said, And you know what those young actors did. They upstaged me. And she said, Do you know what that is. Just withering in her contempt. And I said, Im learning. And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm wrestle, and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like. I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. Again, a remarkable person. Im not politically attracted to her, but through her life force, Im attracted to her. And the way she died, she had, toward the end, a brain tumor. Thats probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine, and very few of us were invited to a dinner party. And she was in horrible pain. We all knew that. She stayed in her room. Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes. The usual sort of thing. Then at a certain moment, the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed. The public self, the beauty, the intellect, and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly. Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up, and this is just a brief reference. It wasnt this arm wrestle, but it was a little surprising for the person involved. I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasnt all that long ago. And we were sitting there, and almost toward the beginning of the interview, I turned to him and I said, Steve, or Mr. Martin, it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods. Was yours unhappy. And he looked at me, you know, as if to say, This is how youre going to start this thing, right off. And then he turned to me, not stupidly, and he said, What was your childhood like. And I said, these are all arm wrestles, but theyre affectionate, and I said, My father was loving and supportive, which is why Im not funny. And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story. His father was an SOB, and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood, but then we were off and running. So the question is. What is the key thats going to allow this to proceed. Now, these are arm wrestle questions, but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really, very often, are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. And Ill just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints. One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers. Again, some of you will know him, most of you wont, Dumas Malone. He did a five volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson, and by the way, at one point I asked him, Would you like to have met him. And he said, Well, of course, but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him, because I got to read all of his letters. So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years. And I asked him one question. I said, Did Jefferson ever disappoint you. And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him, and he said, Well ..., Im going to do a bad southern accent. Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. But he said, Well, he said, Im afraid so. He said, You know, Ive read everything, and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit. And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had, because he saw the letters. He said, But I understand that. He said, I understand that. He said, We southerners do like a smooth surface, so that there were times when he just didnt want the confrontation. And he said, Now, John Adams was too honest. And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house, and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts, and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She was the New Englander and abrasive, and he was this courtly fellow. But really the most important question I ever asked, and most of the times when I talk about it, people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty, but I promise you it was the right question. This was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. She basically created the dances in Oklahoma, transforming the American theater. An amazing woman. At the time that I proposed to her that, by the way, I would have proposed to her, she was extraordinary, but proposed to her that she come on. She said, Come to my apartment. She lived in New York. Come to my apartment and well talk for those 15 minutes, and then well decide whether we proceed. And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment, and she called out to me, and she was in bed. I had known that she had had a stroke, and that was some 10 years before. And so she spent almost all of her life in bed, but, I speak of the life force, her hair was askew. She wasnt about to make up for this occasion. And she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side. She wasnt unhappy about this. She was resigned. She said, I keep this will by my bed, memento mori, and I change it all the time just because I want to. And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life. I thought, this is somebody Ive got to get in this series. She agreed. She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. Half of her body was stricken, the other half not. She was, of course, done up for the occasion, but this was a woman in great physical distress. And we had a conversation, and then I asked her this unthinkable question. I said, Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful. And the audience just, you know, theyre always on the side of the interviewee, and they felt that this was a kind of assault, but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful, and she literally turned, here she was, in this broken body, and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth, and then she said, And then puberty hit. And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face, and how she could no longer count on her beauty, and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company, and in that process, she made a number of decisions. First of all, was that dance, even though it hadnt been offered to her, was her life. And secondly, she had better be, although she did dance for a while, a choreographer because then her looks didnt matter. But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life. It was an amazing privilege to do this series. There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence. The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions, so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are, and I commend that to you, even if youre not doing interviews. Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family. Thank you very much."
"In the 4th century BCE, a bankers son threw the city of Sinope into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, his money, and all his possessions. At least, thats how the story goes. While many of the details of Diogenes life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, he could be truly free. He would live self sufficiently, close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, and knapsack, outdoors year round, forgoing technology, baths, and cooked food. He didnt go about this new existence quietly, but is said to have teased passers by and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating and even masturbating in public. The citizens called him a kyon, a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol for his philosophy, theyre happy creatures, free from abstractions like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number of followers became known as dog philosophers, or kynikoi, a designation that eventually became the word Cynic. These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom of a wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes reputation grew, others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes death, adherents to his philosophy continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone should follow Diogenes example. They also attempted to tone down his philosophy to be more acceptable to conventional society, which, of course, was fundamentally at odds with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self promoting hypocrites, who only preached what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucians texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers called their rivals cynics as an insult, meaning people who criticized others without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork for the modern meaning of the word cynic, a person who thinks everyone else is acting out of pure self interest, even if they claim a higher motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism had admirers, especially among those who wished to question the state of society. The 18th century French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau was called the new Diogenes when he argued that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people. In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche reimagined a story in which Diogenes went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain for a single honest person. In Nietszches version, a so called madman rushes into a town square to proclaim that God is dead. This was Nietzsches way of calling for a revaluation of values, and rejecting the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes for sticking stubbornly to the here and now. More recently, the hippies of the 1960s have been compared with Diogenes as counter cultural rebels. Diogenes ideas have been adopted and reimagined over and over again. The original cynics might not have approved of these fresh takes, they believed that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature were the only true values. Whether or not you agree with that, or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common, they questioned the status quo. And thats an example we can still follow, not to blindly follow conventional or majority views, but to think hard about what is truly valuable."
"Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out were just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that well have to give up and well have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory, basically, its between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts, and theyre both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion, and its the unfortunate fact that we cant think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance. I mean, this is a real cognitive trap. Theres just no way of getting it right. Now, Id like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story, He said hed been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. But it hadnt. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had 20 minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory, the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of reliving the past, but basically it has only the present. Its the experiencing self that the doctor approaches, you know, when the doctor asks, Does it hurt now when I touch you here. And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and its the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, How have you been feeling lately. or How was your trip to Albania. or something like that. Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. Now, the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories, it starts immediately. We dont only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I wont go into detail. Its no longer painful these days, but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s. They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. Here are two patients, those are their recordings. And you are asked, Who of them suffered more. And its a very easy question. Clearly, Patient B suffered more, his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more. But now there is another question, How much did these patients think they suffered. And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great, but one of them is this distinct ... but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end, its a bad story. How do we know that. Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, How bad was the whole thing, in total. And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, B had a worse time. Now, what you could do with Patient A, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work, you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off, and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off, because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story. And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and its also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings. Endings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dominated. Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience, one after the other. And you can ask. What happens to these moments. And the answer is really straightforward. They are lost forever. I mean, most of the moments of our life, and I calculated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long, that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them, in a month, there are about 600,000, most of them dont leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. Its the finite resource that were spending while were on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and theyre really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation. Thats not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self, a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self, time has very little impact on the story. Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and thats the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually dont choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we dont think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesnt need. I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case, that is, we go on vacations, to a very large extent, in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean, how much do we consume our memories. That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. And when I think about that, I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation Ive ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years. Now, if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour. Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question. Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences. So I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed, and youll get an amnesic drug so that you wont remember anything. Now, would you choose the same vacation. And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and its actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. Now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self. So you can ask. How happy is the experiencing self. And then you would ask. How happy are the moments in the experiencing selfs life. And theyre all, happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured. And, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, its a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesnt distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and I belong to a crowd of students of well being, whove been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesnt teach you much about how happily theyre living their life, and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, Oh his father is six feet tall, how much would you know about his height. Well, you would know something about his height, but theres a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low. We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important, goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what Ive said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being. It is a completely different notion. Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live. So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in Ohio. And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and its not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now, because the reflective self is in charge, you may end up, some people may end up moving to California. And its sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen. They will think they are happier, because, when they think about it, theyll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio, and they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well being, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. Thank you. Ive got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now. Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings, vary with income. And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, and thats a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so its a large representative sample, below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... 60,000. 60,000. 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean Ive rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly. In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story. The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it. You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States, no question about that, but in the U.K., it is happening, and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. Its going to take a while, and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness, or whether they want to study life evaluation, so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come. In the United States, efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two, part of national statistics. Well, it seems to me that this issue will, or at least should be, the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you, Danny Kahneman."
"Alright. Im going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. Im going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. The title is Observations of In Utero Masturbation. Okay. Now on the left you can see the hand, thats the big arrow, and the penis on the right. The hand hovering. And over here we have, in the words of radiologist Israel Meisner, The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements. Bear in mind this was an ultrasound, so it would have been moving images. Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system. Now, this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we dont consciously control, like digestion, heart rate and sexual arousal. And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input. Genital stimulation. Duh. But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow. People with spinal cord injuries, like paraplegias, quadriplegias, will often develop a very, very sensitive area right above the level of their injury, wherever that is. There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature. I think the most curious one that I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth. Something in the complex sensory motor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm. And she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated. He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste, but no, it happened with any brand. They stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it. No. It was the whole, you know, motion. And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene. Sadly, this is what it said in the journal paper, She believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care. Its so sad. When I was working on the book, I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm. She was part of a study at Rutgers University. Youve got to love that. Rutgers. So I interviewed her in Oakland, in a sushi restaurant. And I said, So, could you do it right here. And she said, Yeah, but you know Id rather finish my meal if you dont mind. But afterwards, she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside. It was remarkable. It took about one minute. And I said to her, Are you just doing this all the time. She said, No. Honestly, when I get home, Im usually too tired. She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram. The headquarters for orgasm, along the spinal nerve, is something called the sacral nerve root, which is back here. And if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode, the precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm. And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people, a certain kind of dead person, a beating heart cadaver. Now this is somebody who is brain dead, legally dead, definitely checked out, but is being kept alive on a respirator, so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation. Now in one of these brain dead people, if you trigger the right spot, you will see something every now and then. There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex. And this is, Ill demonstrate as best I can, not being dead. Its like this. You trigger the spot. The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that. Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs. Now, if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person, why not the orgasm reflex. I asked this question to a brain death expert, Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails. I said, So, could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person. She said, Yes, if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated, you conceivably could. Obviously it wouldnt be as much fun for the person. But it would be an orgasm, nonetheless. There is a researcher at the University of Alabama who does orgasm research. I said to her, You should do an experiment. You know. You can get cadavers if you work at a university. I said, You should actually do this. She said, You get the human subjects review board approval for this one. According to 1930s marriage manual author, Theodoor van De Velde, a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse. Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur. This is a guy writing a book, Ideal Marriage, you know. Very heavy hetero guy. But he wrote in this book, Ideal Marriage, he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man, which he said had a fresh, exhilarating smell, and the semen of mature men, whose semen smelled, quote, Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut. Sometimes quite freshly floral, and then again sometimes extremely pungent. Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel, a man began hiccupping. And this was one of those cases that went on and on. He tried everything his friends suggested. Nothing seemed to help. Days went by. At a certain point, the man, still hiccupping, had sex with his wife. And lo and behold, the hiccups went away. He told his doctor, who published a case report in a Canadian medical journal under the title, Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups. I love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation. I love that because there is like a whole demographic, unattached hiccuppers. Married, single, unattached hiccupper. In the 1900s, early 1900s, a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm, the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg, thereby upping the odds of conception. It was called the upsuck theory. If you go all the way back to Hippocrates, physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception, but necessary. Doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives. Marriage manual author and semen sniffer Theodoor van De Velde, has a line in his book. I loved this guy. I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde. He had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy, where there was an empress Maria Theresa, who was having trouble conceiving. And apparently the royal court physician said to her, I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse. Its apparently, I dont know, on the record somewhere. Masters and Johnson, now were moving forward to the 1950s. Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics, which is also really fun to say. They didnt buy it. And they decided, being Masters and Johnson, that they would get to the bottom of it. They brought women into the lab, I think it was five women, and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen. And in the artificial semen was a radio opaque substance, such that it would show up on an X ray. This is the 1950s. Anyway, these women sat in front of an X ray device. And they masturbated. And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up. Did not find any evidence of upsuck. You may be wondering, How do you make artificial semen. I have an answer for you. I have two answers. You can use flour and water, or cornstarch and water. I actually found three separate recipes in the literature. My favorite being the one that says, you know, they have the ingredients listed, and then in a recipe it will say, for example, Yield, two dozen cupcakes. This one said, Yield, one ejaculate. Theres another way that orgasm might boost fertility. This one involves men. Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head banging their way into the egg. British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators. He said, If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made. Which I thought was an interesting idea, theory. So now you have an evolutionary excuse. Okay. All righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom, pigs, for instance. In Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her, you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate, which is the number of piglets produced. So they came up with this five point stimulation plan for the sows. There is posters they put in the barn, and they have a DVD. And I got a copy of this DVD. This is my unveiling, because I am going to show you a clip. So, okay. Now, here we go, la la la, off to work. It all looks very innocent. Hes going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay. This is it. The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire. This is to mimic the weight of the boar. You should know, the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina. So this may be sort of titillating for her. Here we go. And the happy result. I love this video. There is a point in this video, towards the beginning, where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring, as if to say, Its okay, its just his job. He really does like women. Okay. When I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie. And I said, So why dont you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig. Why dont you have the farmers do that. Thats not one of your five steps. I have to read you what she said, because I love it. She said, It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva. So we thought, lets not mention the clitoris right now. Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however, can purchase a, this is true, a sow vibrator, that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate. Because, as I mentioned, the clitoris is inside the vagina. So possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks. And I also said to her, Now, these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there. The sow doesnt look to be in the throes of ecstasy. And she said, you cant make that conclusion, because animals dont register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do. Pigs, for example, are more like dogs. They use the upper half of the face, the ears are very expressive. So youre not really sure whats going on with the pig. Primates, on the other hand, we use our mouths more. This is the ejaculation face of the stump tailed macaque. And, interestingly, this has been observed in female macaques, but only when mounting another female. Masters and Johnson. In the 1950s, they decided, okay, were going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle, from arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women, everything that happens in the human body. Okay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside. This did not stop Masters and Johnson. They developed an artificial coition machine. This is basically a penis camera on a motor. There is a phallus, clear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source, attached to a motor that is kind of going like this. And the woman would have sex with it. That is what they would do. Pretty amazing. Sadly, this device has been dismantled. This just kills me, not because I wanted to use it, I wanted to see it. One fine day, Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen. This was not idle curiosity. Doctor Kinsey had heard, and there was a theory going around at the time, this being the 1940s, that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility. Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work. He got together in his lab 300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera. And in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out. It wasnt spurted or thrown or ejected under great force. However, the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark, which is impressive. Yes. Exactly. Sadly, hes anonymous. His name is not mentioned. In his write up of this experiment in his book, Kinsey wrote, Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets. Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey. My favorite being, Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female, but not the male. Thank you very much. Thanks."
"Women represent 50 percent of middle management and professional positions, but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number. So some people hear that statistic and they ask, why do we have so few women leaders. But I look at that statistic and, if you, like me, believe that leadership manifests at every level, you would see that theres a tremendous, awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management, which raises a different question. Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top. So some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization. Well, Tonya is a great example of one of these women. I met her two years ago. She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company, and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration, Ive worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand, I get terrific performance evals from my boss, my 360s in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me, Ive taken every management course that I can here, I am working with a terrific mentor, and yet Ive been passed over twice for advancement opportunities, even when my manager knows that Im committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment. I dont understand why Im being passed over. So what Tonya doesnt realize is that theres a missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women, and its understanding what this missing 33 percent is thats required to close the gender gap at the top. In order to move up in organizations, you have to be known for your leadership skills, and this would apply to any of you, women or men. It means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. Put in other language, it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside. And although all three of these elements of leadership are important, when it comes to moving up in organizations, they arent equally important. So pay attention to the green box as I move forward. In seeking and identifying employees with high potential, the potential to go to the top of organizations, the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership. These skills and competencies can be summarized as business, strategic, and financial acumen. In other words, this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going, what its strategy is, what financial targets it has in place, and understanding your role in moving the organization forward. This is that missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women, not because its missing in our capabilities or abilities, but because its missing in the advice that were given. Heres what I mean by that. Five years ago, I was asked to moderate a panel of executives, and the topic for the evening was What do you look for in high potential employees. So think about the three elements of leadership as I summarize for you what they told me. They said, We look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient. So which element of leadership does that relate to. Personal greatness. They said, We look for employees who are great with our customers, who empower their teams, who negotiate effectively, who are able to manage conflict well, and are overall great communicators. Which element of leadership does that equate to. Engaging the greatness in others. And then they pretty much stopped. So I asked, Well, what about people who understand your business, where its going, and their role in taking it there. And what about people who are able to scan the external environment, identify risks and opportunities, make strategy or make strategic recommendations. And what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business, understand the story that the financials tell, and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations. And to a man, they said, Thats a given. So I turned to the audience of 150 women and I asked, How many of you have ever been told that the door opener for career advancement is your business, strategic and financial acumen, and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool. Three women raised their hand, and Ive asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since, and the percentage is never much different. So this is obvious, right. But how can it be. Well, there are primarily three reasons that theres this missing 33 percent in the career success advice given to women. When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that weve been hearing for over 40 years, theres a notable absence of advice that relates to business, strategic and financial acumen. Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take, like become more assertive, become more confident, develop your personal brand, things that Tonyas been working on, and advice about working with other people, things like learn to self promote, get a mentor, enhance your network, and virtually nothing said about the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen. This doesnt mean that this advice is unimportant. What it means is that this is advice thats absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management, but its not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle, where were 50 percent, to senior and executive positions. And this is why conventional advice to women in 40 years hasnt closed the gender gap at the top and wont close it. Now, the second reason relates to Tonyas comments about having had excellent performance evals, great feedback from her teams, and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on. So you would think that shes getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business, strategic and financial acumen, but here again, that green square is quite small. On average, talent and performance management systems in the organizations that Ive worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen, which is why typical talent and performance systems havent closed and wont close the gender gap at the top. Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor, and this is really important to talk about, because if organizations, talent and performance systems arent giving people in general information about the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen, how are men getting to the top. Well, there are primarily two ways. One is because of the positions theyre guided into, and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship. So whats womens experience as it relates to mentoring. Well, this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience. He was very proud of the fact that last year, he had two proteges, a man and a woman. And he said, I helped the woman build confidence, I helped the man learn the business, and I didnt realize that I was treating them any differently. And he was sincere about that. So what this illustrates is that as managers, whether were women or men, we have mindsets about women and men, about careers in leadership, and these unexamined mindsets wont close the gender gap at the top. So how do we take this idea of the missing 33 percent and turn it into action. Well, for women, the answer is obvious, we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that were people who understand our businesses, where theyre headed, and our role in taking it there. Thats what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top. But you dont have to be a middle manager to do this. One young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing 33 percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room. So we dont want to put 100 percent of the responsibility on womens shoulders, nor would it be wise to do so, and heres why. In order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals, executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction. In other words, the term we use in business is, we have to have strategic alignment. And executives know this very well, and yet only 37 percent, according to a recent Conference Board report, believe that they have that strategic alignment in place. So for 63 percent of organizations, achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable. And if you think about what Ive just shared, that you have situations where at least 50 percent of your middle managers havent received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business, where its headed, and their role in taking it there, its not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low, which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this. Its important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions. Why. Because if they arent seeing that, it could be a red flag that their organization isnt as aligned as it could potentially be. Its important for CEOs to also expect these proportional pools, and if they hear comments like, Well, she doesnt have enough business experience, ask the question, What are we going to do about that. Its important for H.R. executives to make sure that the missing 33 percent is appropriately emphasized, and its important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men, about careers and success, to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody. So let me close with the latest chapter in Tonyas story. Tonya emailed me two months ago, and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position, and during the interview, they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry, and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the chief information officer at her company. So for some of you, the missing 33 percent is an idea for you to put into action, and I hope that for all of you, you will see it as an idea worth spreading in order to help organizations be more effective, to help women create careers that soar, and to help close the gender gap at the top. Thank you. "
"I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one. We all know the Earth is in trouble. We have now entered in the 6X, the sixth major extinction on this planet. I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms, otherwise known as Uh Oh, , and every organism had a right to vote, would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet. I think that vote is occurring right now. I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions, using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium. The mycelium infuses all landscapes, it holds soils together, its extremely tenacious. This holds up to 30,000 times its mass. Theyre the grand molecular disassemblers of nature, the soil magicians. They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth. We have now discovered that there is a multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium, so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs. Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church. Im in love with the old growth forest, and Im a patriotic American because we have those. Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms. And frankly, I face a big obstacle. When I mention mushrooms to somebody, they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms, their eyes glaze over, and they think Im a little crazy. So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. We call it mycophobia, the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi. Mushrooms are very fast in their growth. Day 21, day 23, day 25. Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics. In fact, were more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom. A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta, a super kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together. We share in common the same pathogens. Fungi dont like to rot from bacteria, and so our best antibiotics come from fungi. But here is a mushroom thats past its prime. After they sporulate, they do rot. But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest. They give rise to the trees, they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. And so we see a mushroom here sporulating. And the spores are germinating, and the mycelium forms and goes underground. In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells. My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium. This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. And notice that as the mycelium grows, it conquers territory and then it begins the net. Ive been a scanning electron microscopist for many years, I have thousands of electron micrographs, and when Im staring at the mycelium, I realize that they are microfiltration membranes. We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium. It inhales oxygen, just like we do. But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs. And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes. And in these cavities, these micro cavities form, and as they fuse soils, they absorb water. These are little wells. And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form. And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion, but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms. I first proposed, in the early 1990s, that mycelium is Earths natural Internet. When you look at the mycelium, theyre highly branched. And if theres one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing, Internet engineers maybe call them hot points, there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. The mycelium is sentient. It knows that you are there. When you walk across landscapes, it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris. So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven, biologically successful model. The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit, and we now, being the top organism on this planet, are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype. I believe matter begets life, life becomes single cells, single cells become strings, strings become chains, chains network. And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe. Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. They came to land 1.3 billion years ago, and plants followed several hundred million years later. How is that possible. Its possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids, and many other acids and enzymes, pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates. Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil. Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together. So, fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates. And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. This was first discovered in 1859. This is a photograph by Franz Hueber. This photographs taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia. 420 million years ago, this organism existed. It was called Prototaxites. Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall. The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet. Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago, published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus, a giant mushroom. Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms. All across most land masses. And these existed for tens of millions of years. Now, weve had several extinction events, and as we march forward, 65 million years ago, most of you know about it, we had an asteroid impact. The Earth was struck by an asteroid, a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere. Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth. Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded, because fungi do not need light. More recently, at Einstein University, they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy, much like plants use light. So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere, I think, is a forgone conclusion, at least in my own mind. The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon. I couldnt miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size, 2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old. The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick. How is it that this organism can be so large, and yet be one cell wall thick, whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us. The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom, it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt. We were involved with several experiments. Im going to show you six, if I can, solutions for helping to save the world. Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington. There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste, one was a control pile, one pile was treated with enzymes, one pile was treated with bacteria, and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium. The mycelium absorbs the oil. The mycelium is producing enzymes, peroxidases, that break carbon hydrogen bonds. These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together. So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil, and then, when we returned six weeks later, all the tarps were removed, all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky. We came back to our pile, it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms, and the color changed to a light form. The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates, fungal sugars. Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms. Theyre very large. Theyre showing how much nutrition that they couldve obtained. But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life. They sporulated, the spores attract insects, the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae. Birds then came, bringing in seeds, and our pile became an oasis of life. Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky, and the PAHs, the aromatic hydrocarbons, went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks. The last image we dont have. The entire pile was a green berm of life. These are gateway species, vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities. So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn, and putting the mycelium, using storm blown debris, you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm thats producing E. coli, or other wastes, or a factory with chemical toxins, and it leads to habitat restoration. So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington, and weve seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms. And Ill show you a graph here. This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power. Theres more than a 100 million colonies per gram, and 10 to the third power is around 1,000. In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times. Think of the implications. This is a space conservative method that uses storm debris, and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time. This is my wife Dusty, with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis, Agarikon. Its a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D. as a treatment against consumption. This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon, northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe. May not seem that large, lets get closer. This is extremely rare fungus. Our team, and we have a team of experts that go out, we went out 20 times in the old growth forest last year. We found one sample to be able to get into culture. Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health. Ive been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program. We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water, and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. And a few years ago, we received these results. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses. Dr. Earl Kern, whos a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active. 10 or greater are considered to be very active. Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range. Theres a vetted press release that you can read, its vetted by DOD, if you Google Stamets and smallpox. Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses. And so, for the first time, I am showing this. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. Heres the selectivity index numbers, against pox, you saw 10s and 20s, now against flu viruses, compared to the ribavirin controls, we have an extraordinarily high activity. And were using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. We tried it against flu A viruses, H1N1, H3N2, as well as flu B viruses. So then we tried a blend, and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1, and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index. I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense. I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi, fungi that kill insects. Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants. So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites. I did something that nobody else had done. I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores. These are spores, this is in their spores. I was able to morph the culture into a non sporulating form. And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house. But the insects arent stupid, and they would avoid the spores when they came close, and so I morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form. And I got my daughters Barbie doll dish, I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields, every day, in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium, because theres no spores. They gave it to the queen. One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. And then, a delicate dance between dinner and death, the mycelium is consumed by the ants, they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head. Now after sporulation, the spores repel. So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion. So, you have a near permanent solution for reinvasion of termites. And so my house came down, I received my first patent against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants. Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold, we can steer insects to different directions. This has huge implications. I then received my second patent, and this is a big one. Its been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent. It covers over 200,000 species. This is the most disruptive technology, Ive been told by executives of the pesticide industry, that they have ever witnessed. This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world. You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept, because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi, prior to sporulation, attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores. And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system. The Life Box, youre gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference, you add soil, you add water, you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores, like of the Agarikon mushroom. The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. And then you put tree seeds in here, and then you end up growing, potentially, an old growth forest from a cardboard box. I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints. If theres a YouTube like site that you could put up, you could make it interactive, zip code specific, where people could join together, and through satellite imaging systems, through Virtual Earth or Google Earth, you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes. You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes, you could add water, I developed this for the refugee community, corns, beans and squash and onions. I took several containers, my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could, and I ended up growing a seed garden. Then you harvest the seeds, and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this, and then youre harvesting the seed garden. Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels. I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs. Now, three corncobs, no other grain, lots of mushrooms begin to form. Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank, and so this population will be shut down. But watch what happens here. The mushrooms then are harvested, but very importantly, the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars. And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country. And we came up with Econol. Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary, and you gain all the benefits that Ive described to you already. But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent, and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels. So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils. These are a species that we need to join with. I think engaging mycelium can help save the world. Thank you very much. "
"Im going to begin with a scary question. Are we headed toward a future without jobs. The remarkable progress that were seeing in technologies like self driving cars has led to an explosion of interest in this question, but because its something thats been asked so many times in the past, maybe what we should really be asking is whether this time is really different. The fear that automation might displace workers and potentially lead to lots of unemployment goes back at a minimum 200 years to the Luddite revolts in England. And since then, this concern has come up again and again. Im going to guess that most of you have probably never heard of the Triple Revolution report, but this was a very prominent report. It was put together by a brilliant group of people, it actually included two Nobel laureates, and this report was presented to the President of the United States, and it argued that the US was on the brink of economic and social upheaval because industrial automation was going to put millions of people out of work. Now, that report was delivered to President Lyndon Johnson in March of 1964. So thats now over 50 years, and, of course, that hasnt really happened. And thats been the story again and again. This alarm has been raised repeatedly, but its always been a false alarm. And because its been a false alarm, its led to a very conventional way of thinking about this. And that says essentially that yes, technology may devastate entire industries. It may wipe out whole occupations and types of work. But at the same time, of course, progress is going to lead to entirely new things. So there will be new industries that will arise in the future, and those industries, of course, will have to hire people. Therell be new kinds of work that will appear, and those might be things that today we cant really even imagine. And that has been the story so far, and its been a positive story. It turns out that the new jobs that have been created have generally been a lot better than the old ones. They have, for example, been more engaging. Theyve been in safer, more comfortable work environments, and, of course, theyve paid more. So it has been a positive story. Thats the way things have played out so far. But there is one particular class of worker for whom the story has been quite different. For these workers, technology has completely decimated their work, and it really hasnt created any new opportunities at all. And these workers, of course, are horses. So I can ask a very provocative question. Is it possible that at some point in the future, a significant fraction of the human workforce is going to be made redundant in the way that horses were. Now, you might have a very visceral, reflexive reaction to that. You might say, Thats absurd. How can you possibly compare human beings to horses. Horses, of course, are very limited, and when cars and trucks and tractors came along, horses really had nowhere else to turn. People, on the other hand, are intelligent, we can learn, we can adapt. And in theory, that ought to mean that we can always find something new to do, and that we can always remain relevant to the future economy. But heres the really critical thing to understand. The machines that will threaten workers in the future are really nothing like those cars and trucks and tractors that displaced horses. The future is going to be full of thinking, learning, adapting machines. And what that really means is that technology is finally beginning to encroach on that fundamental human capability, the thing that makes us so different from horses, and the very thing that, so far, has allowed us to stay ahead of the march of progress and remain relevant, and, in fact, indispensable to the economy. So what is it that is really so different about todays information technology relative to what weve seen in the past. I would point to three fundamental things. The first thing is that we have seen this ongoing process of exponential acceleration. I know you all know about Moores law, but in fact, its more broad based than that, it extends in many cases, for example, to software, it extends to communications, bandwidth and so forth. But the really key thing to understand is that this acceleration has now been going on for a really long time. In fact, its been going on for decades. If you measure from the late 1950s, when the first integrated circuits were fabricated, weve seen something on the order of 30 doublings in computational power since then. Thats just an extraordinary number of times to double any quantity, and what it really means is that were now at a point where were going to see just an extraordinary amount of absolute progress, and, of course, things are going to continue to also accelerate from this point. So as we look forward to the coming years and decades, I think that means that were going to see things that were really not prepared for. Were going to see things that astonish us. The second key thing is that the machines are, in a limited sense, beginning to think. And by this, I dont mean human level AI, or science fiction artificial intelligence. I simply mean that machines and algorithms are making decisions. Theyre solving problems, and most importantly, theyre learning. In fact, if theres one technology that is truly central to this and has really become the driving force behind this, its machine learning, which is just becoming this incredibly powerful, disruptive, scalable technology. One of the best examples Ive seen of that recently was what Googles DeepMind division was able to do with its AlphaGo system. Now, this is the system that was able to beat the best player in the world at the ancient game of Go. Now, at least to me, there are two things that really stand out about the game of Go. One is that as youre playing the game, the number of configurations that the board can be in is essentially infinite. There are actually more possibilities than there are atoms in the universe. So what that means is, youre never going to be able to build a computer to win at the game of Go the way chess was approached, for example, which is basically to throw brute force computational power at it. So clearly, a much more sophisticated, thinking like approach is needed. The second thing that really stands out is that, if you talk to one of the championship Go players, this person cannot necessarily even really articulate what exactly it is theyre thinking about as they play the game. Its often something thats very intuitive, its almost just like a feeling about which move they should make. So given those two qualities, I would say that playing Go at a world champion level really ought to be something thats safe from automation, and the fact that it isnt should really raise a cautionary flag for us. And the reason is that we tend to draw a very distinct line, and on one side of that line are all the jobs and tasks that we perceive as being on some level fundamentally routine and repetitive and predictable. And we know that these jobs might be in different industries, they might be in different occupations and at different skill levels, but because they are innately predictable, we know theyre probably at some point going to be susceptible to machine learning, and therefore, to automation. And make no mistake, thats a lot of jobs. Thats probably something on the order of roughly half the jobs in the economy. But then on the other side of that line, we have all the jobs that require some capability that we perceive as being uniquely human, and these are the jobs that we think are safe. Now, based on what I know about the game of Go, I wouldve guessed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line. But the fact that it isnt, and that Google solved this problem, suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic. Its going to shift, and its going to shift in a way that consumes more and more jobs and tasks that we currently perceive as being safe from automation. The other key thing to understand is that this is by no means just about low wage jobs or blue collar jobs, or jobs and tasks done by people that have relatively low levels of education. Theres lots of evidence to show that these technologies are rapidly climbing the skills ladder. So we already see an impact on professional jobs, tasks done by people like accountants, financial analysts, journalists, lawyers, radiologists and so forth. So a lot of the assumptions that we make about the kind of occupations and tasks and jobs that are going to be threatened by automation in the future are very likely to be challenged going forward. So as we put these trends together, I think what it shows is that we could very well end up in a future with significant unemployment. Or at a minimum, we could face lots of underemployment or stagnant wages, maybe even declining wages. And, of course, soaring levels of inequality. All of that, of course, is going to put a terrific amount of stress on the fabric of society. But beyond that, theres also a fundamental economic problem, and that arises because jobs are currently the primary mechanism that distributes income, and therefore purchasing power, to all the consumers that buy the products and services were producing. In order to have a vibrant market economy, youve got to have lots and lots of consumers that are really capable of buying the products and services that are being produced. If you dont have that, then you run the risk of economic stagnation, or maybe even a declining economic spiral, as there simply arent enough customers out there to buy the products and services being produced. Its really important to realize that all of us as individuals rely on access to that market economy in order to be successful. You can visualize that by thinking in terms of one really exceptional person. Imagine for a moment you take, say, Steve Jobs, and you drop him on an island all by himself. On that island, hes going to be running around, gathering coconuts just like anyone else. Hes really not going to be anything special, and the reason, of course, is that there is no market for him to scale his incredible talents across. So access to this market is really critical to us as individuals, and also to the entire system in terms of it being sustainable. So the question then becomes. What exactly could we do about this. And I think you can view this through a very utopian framework. You can imagine a future where we all have to work less, we have more time for leisure, more time to spend with our families, more time to do things that we find genuinely rewarding and so forth. And I think thats a terrific vision. Thats something that we should absolutely strive to move toward. But at the same time, I think we have to be realistic, and we have to realize that were very likely to face a significant income distribution problem. A lot of people are likely to be left behind. And I think that in order to solve that problem, were ultimately going to have to find a way to decouple incomes from traditional work. And the best, more straightforward way I know to do that is some kind of a guaranteed income or universal basic income. Now, basic income is becoming a very important idea. Its getting a lot of traction and attention, there are a lot of important pilot projects and experiments going on throughout the world. My own view is that a basic income is not a panacea, its not necessarily a plug and play solution, but rather, its a place to start. Its an idea that we can build on and refine. For example, one thing that I have written quite a lot about is the possibility of incorporating explicit incentives into a basic income. To illustrate that, imagine that you are a struggling high school student. Imagine that you are at risk of dropping out of school. And yet, suppose you know that at some point in the future, no matter what, youre going to get the same basic income as everyone else. Now, to my mind, that creates a very perverse incentive for you to simply give up and drop out of school. So I would say, lets not structure things that way. Instead, lets pay people who graduate from high school somewhat more than those who simply drop out. And we can take that idea of building incentives into a basic income, and maybe extend it to other areas. For example, we might create an incentive to work in the community to help others, or perhaps to do positive things for the environment, and so forth. So by incorporating incentives into a basic income, we might actually improve it, and also, perhaps, take at least a couple of steps towards solving another problem that I think were quite possibly going to face in the future, and that is, how do we all find meaning and fulfillment, and how do we occupy our time in a world where perhaps theres less demand for traditional work. So by extending and refining a basic income, I think we can make it look better, and we can also, perhaps, make it more politically and socially acceptable and feasible, and, of course, by doing that, we increase the odds that it will actually come to be. I think one of the most fundamental, almost instinctive objections that many of us have to the idea of a basic income, or really to any significant expansion of the safety net, is this fear that were going to end up with too many people riding in the economic cart, and not enough people pulling that cart. And yet, really, the whole point Im making here, of course, is that in the future, machines are increasingly going to be capable of pulling that cart for us. That should give us more options for the way we structure our society and our economy, And I think eventually, its going to go beyond simply being an option, and its going to become an imperative. The reason, of course, is that all of this is going to put such a degree of stress on our society, and also because jobs are that mechanism that gets purchasing power to consumers so they can then drive the economy. If, in fact, that mechanism begins to erode in the future, then were going to need to replace it with something else or were going to face the risk that our whole system simply may not be sustainable. But the bottom line here is that I really think that solving these problems, and especially finding a way to build a future economy that works for everyone, at every level of our society, is going to be one of the most important challenges that we all face in the coming years and decades. Thank you very much. "
"I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend, Richard Feynman. I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. And Im going to tell you about the Richard Feynman that I knew. Im sure there are people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew, and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. Richard Feynman was a very complex man. He was a man of many, many parts. He was, of course, foremost, a very, very, very great scientist. He was an actor. You saw him act. I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures, up in the balcony. They were fantastic. He was a philosopher. He was a drum player. He was a teacher par excellence. Richard Feynman was also a showman, an enormous showman. He was brash, irreverent. He was full of macho, a kind of macho one upmanship. He loved intellectual battle. He had a gargantuan ego. But the man had, somehow, a lot of room at the bottom. And what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case, I cant speak for anybody else, but in my case, a lot of room for another big ego. Well, not as big as his, but fairly big. I always felt good with Dick Feynman. It was always fun to be with him. He always made me feel smart. How can somebody like that make you feel smart. Somehow he did. He made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart. He made me feel we were both smart, and the two of us could solve any problem whatever. And in fact, we did sometimes do physics together. We never published a paper together, but we did have a lot of fun. He loved to win, win these little macho games we would sometimes play. And he didnt only play them with me, but with all sorts of people. He would almost always win. But when he didnt win, when he lost, he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. I remember once he told me a story about a joke the students played on him. I think it was for his birthday, they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in Pasadena. It may still exist. I dont know. Celebrity sandwiches was their thing. You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich. You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich. The students went there in advance, and arranged that theyd all order Feynman sandwiches. One after another, they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches. Feynman loved this story. He told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing. When he finished the story, I said to him, Dick, I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich. And without skipping a beat at all, he said, Well, theyd be about the same. The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham. Ham as in bad actor. Well, I happened to have been very quick that day, and I said, Yeah, but a lot less baloney. The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham, but absolutely no baloney. What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense, phoniness, false sophistication, jargon. I remember sometime during the mid 80s, Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco, at some very rich guys house, up in San Francisco for dinner. And the last time the rich guy invited us, he also invited a couple of philosophers. These guys were philosophers of mind. Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. And they were full of all kinds of jargon. Im trying to remember the words, monism, dualism, categories all over the place. I didnt know what those meant, neither did Dick or Sydney, for that matter. And what did we talk about. Well, what do you talk about when you talk about minds. Theres one obvious thing to talk about. Can a machine become a mind. Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being that is conscious. We sat around and talked about this, we of course never resolved it. But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science ophizing. Its a scientific question, after all. And this was a very, very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feynman. Feynman let them have it, both barrels, right between the eyes. It was brutal, it was funny, ooh, it was funny. But it was really brutal. He really popped their balloon. But the amazing thing was, Feynman had to leave a little early, he wasnt feeling too well, so he left a little bit early. And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers. And the amazing thing is these guys were flying. They were so happy. They had met the great man, they had been instructed by the great man, they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud ... And it was something special. I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman, even when he did what he did. Dick, he was my friend. I did call him Dick, Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport. I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. We liked each other, we liked the same kind of things. I also like the intellectual macho games. Sometimes I would win, mostly he would win, but we both enjoyed them. And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality. I dont think he was right. I think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves. But he was convinced of this. And the man was incredibly curious. And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection. And one day, we were walking. We were in France, in Les Houches. We were up in the mountains, 1976. And Feynman said to me, Leonardo ... The reason he called me Leonardo is because we were in Europe, and he was practicing his French. And he said, Leonardo, were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid. I said, Well, my real hero was my father. He was a working man, had a fifth grade education. He was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools. He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things. He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem. He didnt call it the hypotenuse, he called it the shortcut distance. And Feynmans eyes just opened up. He went off like a lightbulb. And he said that he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father. In fact, he had been convinced at one time that to be a good physicist, it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father. I apologize for the sexist conversation here, but this is the way it really happened. He said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary, a necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist. Being Dick, he, of course, wanted to check this. He wanted to go out and do an experiment. Well, he did. He went out and did an experiment. He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists, Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you. They were all men, and to a man, every single one of them said, My mother. There went that theory, down the trash can of history. But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with his father as he had with his father. And for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. I dont know. Maybe. Who knows. But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist. Feynmans style, no, style is not the right word. Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn, or the suit he was wearing. Its something much deeper than that, but I cant think of another word for it. Feynmans scientific style was always to look for the simplest, most elementary solution to a problem that was possible. If it wasnt possible, you had to use something fancier. No doubt, part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could. But he also deeply believed, he truly believed, that if you couldnt explain something simply, you didnt understand it. In the 1950s, people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked. There was a theory. It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist. It was a complicated theory. Ill tell you what it was soon enough. It was a terribly complicated theory, full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth. And it sort of worked, but it didnt work very well. The only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very, very far apart. And unfortunately, the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other. Feynman decided, as a sort of amateur helium physicist, that he would try to figure it out. He had an idea, a very clear idea. He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. He would try to visualize it, guided by a small number of simple principles. The small number of simple principles were very, very simple. The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel. The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero, it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other. The other fact is that in the ground state, the lowest energy state of a quantum system, the wave function is always very smooth, it has the minimum number of wiggles. So he sat down, and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil, and he tried to write down, and did write down, the simplest function that he could think of, which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. He wrote down a simple thing, so simple, in fact, that I suspect a really smart high school student who didnt even have calculus could understand what he wrote down. The thing was, that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium, and then some. Ive always wondered whether the professionals, the real professional helium physicists, were just a little bit embarrassed by this. They had their super powerful technique, and they couldnt do as well. Incidentally, Ill tell you what that super powerful technique was. It was the technique of Feynman diagrams. He did it again in 1968. In 1968, in my own university, I wasnt there at the time, they were exploring the structure of the proton. The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles, this was more or less known. And the way to analyze it was, of course, Feynman diagrams. Thats what Feynman diagrams were constructed for, to understand particles. The experiments that were going on were very simple, you simply take the proton, and you hit it really sharply with an electron. This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for. The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated. Theyre difficult integrals. If you could do all of them, you would have a very precise theory, but you couldnt, they were just too complicated. People were trying to do them. You could do a one loop diagram. Dont worry about one loop. One loop, two loops, maybe you could do a three loop diagram, but beyond that, you couldnt do anything. Feynman said, Forget all of that. Just think of the proton as an assemblage, a swarm, of little particles. He called them partons. He said, Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast. Because theyre moving real fast, relativity says the internal motions go very slow. The electron hits it suddenly, its like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton. What do you see. You see a frozen bunch of partons. They dont move, and because they dont move during the course of the experiment, you dont have to worry about how theyre moving. You dont have to worry about the forces between them. You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons. This was the key to analyzing these experiments. Extremely effective. Somebody said the word revolution is a bad word. I suppose it is, so I wont say revolution, but it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton, and of particles beyond that. Well, I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman, what he was like, but I see I have exactly half a minute. So I think Ill just finish up by saying. I actually dont think Feynman would have liked this event. I think he would have said, I dont need this. But ... How should we honor Feynman. How should we really honor Feynman. I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can. Thank you. "
"The Hindus say, Nada brahma, one translation of which is, The world is sound. And in a way, thats true, because everything is vibrating. In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. So you are, in fact, a chord, each of you an individual chord. One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. Your ears cant hear that chord, they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves. Incidentally, we see just one octave. Your ears are always on, you have no ear lids. They work even when you sleep. The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. Ears are made not for hearing, but for listening. Listening is an active skill, whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at, its a relationship with sound. And yet its a skill that none of us are taught. For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from. Here are two of them. Reductive listening is listening for. It reduces everything down to whats relevant and it discards everything thats not relevant. Men typically listen reductively. So hes saying, Ive got this problem. Hes saying, Heres your solution. Thanks very much. Next. Thats the way we talk, right guys. Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening with, not listening for. Its got no destination in mind, its just enjoying the journey. Women typically listen expansively. If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other, possibly both talking at the same time. Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk, practice expansive listening, and you can transform your relationships. The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise, surrounding us all the time. Noise like this, according to the European Union, is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of Europe. Two percent of the population of Europe, thats 16 million people, are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe. Its a really big problem. Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didnt want to hear it, youd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler. It looks a bit like this. The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined, schizophonia. Its a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. So, were inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. I think theres something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. Listen to this, this is an uncompressed piece of music. And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed. I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two. There is a cost of compression. It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. Youre having to imagine it. Its not good for you in the long run. The third problem with headphones is this, deafness, noise induced hearing disorder. Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another, but really worryingly, 16 percent, roughly one in six, of American teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. One study at an American university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse. We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. Now thats a really serious problem. Ill give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children, please. Professional hearing protectors are great. I use some all the time. If youre going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you dont have to have it so loud. If you cant hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice, its too loud. And thirdly, if youre in bad sound, its fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. Protect your ears in that way. Lets move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. Wind, water, birds, stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events, all of it very healthy, all of it sound that we evolved to over the years. Seek those sounds out, theyre good for you and so it this. Silence is beautiful. The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion. Its fun to get into designing with sound. If you cant do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you. Sound design is the future, and I think its the way were going to change the way the world sounds. Im going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health. First, ultrasound, were very familiar with it from physical therapy, its also now being used to treat cancer. Lithotripsy, saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound. Sound healing is a wonderful modality. Its been around for thousands of years. I do urge you to explore this. There are great things being done there, treating now autism, dementia and other conditions. And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you, if its music thats made with good intention, made with love, generally. Devotional music, good, Mozart, good. There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. First of all, listen consciously. I hope that that after this talk youll be doing that. Its a whole new dimension to your life and its wonderful to have that dimension. Secondly, get in touch with making some sound, create sound. The voice is the instrument we all play, and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice. Get trained, learn to sing, learn to play an instrument. Musicians have bigger brains, its true. You can do this in groups as well. Its a fantastic antidote to schizophonia, to make music and sound in a group of people, whichever style you enjoy particularly. And lets take a stewarding role for the sound around us. Protect your ears. Yes, absolutely. Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. And lets start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. So Im going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things, we will take a very big step in that direction. So I urge you to take that path. Im leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you. I wish you sound health. "
"When a team of archaeologists recently came across some 15,000 year old human remains, they made an interesting discovery. The teeth of those ancient humans were riddled with holes. Their cavities were caused by the same thing that still plagues us today, specific tiny microbes that live in our mouths. These microbes are with us soon after birth. We typically pick them up as babies from our mothers mouths. And as our teeth erupt, they naturally begin to accumulate communities of bacteria. Depending on what we eat, and specifically how much sugar we consume, certain microbes can overpopulate and cause cavities. Diets high in sugary foods cause an explosion of bacteria called mutans streptococci in our mouths. Like humans, these microorganisms love sugar, using it as a molecular building block and energy source. As they consume it, the bacteria generate byproducts in the form of acids, such as lactic acid. Mutans streptococci are resistant to this acid, but unfortunately, our teeth arent. While each human tooth is coated in a hardy, protective layer of enamel, its no match for acid. That degrades the armor over time, leaching away its calcium minerals. Gradually, acid wears down a pathway for bacteria into the tooths secondary layer called the dentin. Since blood vessels and nerves in our teeth are enclosed deep within, at this stage, the expanding cavity doesnt hurt. But if the damage extends beyond the dentin, the bacterial invasion progresses causing excruciating pain as the nerves become exposed. Without treatment, the whole tooth may become infected and require removal all due to those sugar loving bacteria. The more sugar our food contains, the more our teeth are put at risk. Those cavemen would hardly have indulged in sugary treats, however, so what caused their cavities. In meat heavy diets, there would have been a low risk of cavities developing because lean meat contains very little sugar, but thats not all our early human ancestors ate. Cavemen would also have consumed root vegetables, nuts, and grains, all of which contain carbohydrates. When exposed to enzymes in the saliva, carbohydrates get broken down into simpler sugars, which can become the fodder for those ravenous mouth bacteria. So while ancient humans did eat less sugar compared to us, their teeth were still exposed to sugars. That doesnt mean they were unable to treat their cavities, though. Archaeological remains show that about 14,000 years ago, humans were already using sharpened flint to remove bits of rotten teeth. Ancient humans even made rudimentary drills to smooth out the rough holes left behind and beeswax to plug cavities, like modern day fillings. Today, we have much more sophisticated techniques and tools, which is fortunate because we also need to contend with our more damaging, sugar guzzling ways. After the Industrial Revolution, the human incidence of cavities surged because suddenly we had technological advances that made refined sugar cheaper and accessible. Today, an incredible 92 percent of American adults have had cavities in their teeth. Some people are more susceptible to cavities due to genes that may cause certain weaknesses, like softer enamel, but for most, high sugar consumption is to blame. However, we have developed other ways of minimizing cavities besides reducing our intake of sugar and starch. In most toothpastes and many water supplies, we use tiny amounts of fluoride. That strengthens teeth and encourages the growth of enamel crystals that build up a tooths defenses against acid. When cavities do develop, we use tooth fillings to fill and close off the infected area, preventing them from getting worse. The best way to avoid a cavity is still cutting down on sugar intake and practicing good oral hygiene to get rid of the bacteria and their food sources. That includes regular tooth brushing, flossing, and avoiding sugary, starchy, and sticky foods that cling to your teeth between meals. Gradually, the population of sugar loving microbes in your mouth will decline. Unlike the cavemen of yesteryear, today we have the knowledge required to avert a cavity calamity. We just need to use it."
"Hi everyone. Im an artist and a dad, second time around. Thank you. And I want to share with you my latest art project. Its a childrens book for the iPad. Its a little quirky and silly. Its called Pop It, And its about the things little kids do with their parents. So this is about potty training, as most of you, I hope, know. You can tickle the rug. You can make the baby poop. You can do all those fun things. You can burst bubbles. You can draw, as everyone should. But you know, I have a problem with childrens books. I think theyre full of propaganda. At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it. Its not the way I was brought up. So I said, Im going to counter this with my own propaganda. If you notice carefully, its a homosexual couple bringing up a child. You dont like it. Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple. Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple. You know, I dont even believe in the concept of an ideal family. I have to tell you about my childhood. I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters. Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am. And Id go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood. Basically, I celebrated every religious function. In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding. I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani. We all had to fast during Ramadan. It was a very beautiful time. But I must say, Ill never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened. Babri Masjid, one of the most beautiful mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century, was demolished by Hindu activists. This caused major riots in my city. And for the first time, I was affected by this communal unrest. My little five year old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, Rags, Rags. You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful. Im like, Dude, Im Hindu. Hes like, Huh. You know, my work is inspired by events such as this. Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. Imagine history being taught differently. Remember that childrens book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change. I have another idea. Its a childrens book about Indian independence, very patriotic. But when you shake it, you get Pakistans perspective. Shake it again, and you get the British perspective. You have to separate fact from bias, right. Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals. But theyre playing geopolitics. Theyre playing out Israel Palestine, India Pakistan. You know, Im making a very important argument. And my argument is that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. After all, childrens books are manuals on parenting, so you better give them childrens books that teach them perspectives. And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. Im making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy. You know, I cant promise my child a life without bias, were all biased, but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. Thank you very much. "
"In the summer of 1997, NASAs Pathfinder spacecraft landed on the surface of Mars, and began transmitting incredible, iconic images back to Earth. But several days in, something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, procrastinating, keeping itself fully occupied but failing to do its most important work. What was going on. There was a bug, it turned out, in its scheduler. Every operating system has something called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you arent spending doing it. For instance, lets say when you check your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once youve dealt with that one, you repeat. Seems sensible, but theres a problem here. This is whats known as a quadratic time algorithm. With an inbox thats twice as full, these passes will take twice as long and youll need to do twice as many of them. This means four times the work. The programmers of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers counterintuitive solution was to replace this full ranking with a limited number of priority buckets. The system was less precise about what to do next but more than made up for it by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller than normal could take nine times longer to clear. Youd be better off replying in chronological order, or even at random. Surprisingly, sometimes giving up on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent features of modern life, interruptions. When a computer goes from one task to another, it has to do whats called a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that theres a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting anytime something comes up. These two principles are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then thats exactly how often you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with things as they come up Oh, the mouse was moved. A key was pressed. More of that file downloaded. the system groups these interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement in laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions lets a system check everything at once, then quickly reenter a low power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users to reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things that feels so rare in modern life, rest."
"Ive been a journalist for more than 23 years, at the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, the Pittsburgh Tribune Review and most recently, The Denver Post. When I started at The Denver Post in 2003, it was among the countrys 10 largest newspapers, with an impressive subscriber base and nearly 300 journalists. At the time, I was in my 30s. Any ambitious journalist that age aspires to work for one of the big national papers, like The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. But I was simply blown away by my first few weeks at The Denver Post, and I thought, This is going to be my paper. I can make a career right here. Well, seven years passed, we were sold to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. Within a few years, Some of you know this story. Within a few years, buyouts ordered by past and present owners would reduce the newsroom by nearly half. And I understood. The rule of thumb used to be that 80 percent of a newspapers revenue came from pricy print ads and classifieds. With emerging giants like Google and Facebook and Craigslist, those advertizing dollars were evaporating. The entire industry was undergoing a massive shift from print to digital. Aldens orders were to be digital first. Take advantage of blogs, video and social media. They said that one day, the money we made online would make up for the money we lost in print. But that day never came. In 2013, we won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the Aurora theater shooting. Alden ordered that more journalists be cut. Again, and again, and again, and again. We were forced to say goodbye to talented, hardworking journalists we considered not just friends but family. Those of us left behind were stretched impossibly thin, covering multiple beats and writing rushed articles. Inside a windowless meeting room in March of 2018, we learned that 30 more would have to go. This paper that once had 300 journalists would now have 70. And it didnt make sense. Here, wed won multiple Pulitzer Prizes. We shifted our focus from print to digital, we hit ambitious targets and email from the brass talked up the Posts profit margins, which industry experts pegged at nearly 20 percent. So if our company was so successful and so profitable, why was our newsroom getting so much smaller and smaller. I knew that what was happening in Colorado was happening around the country. Since 2004, nearly 1,800 newsrooms have closed. Youve heard of food deserts. These are news deserts. They are communities, often entire counties, with little to zero news coverage whatsoever. Making matters worse, many papers have become ghost ships, pretending to sail with a newsroom but really just wrapping ads around filler copy. More and more newsrooms are being sold off to companies like Alden. And in that meeting, their intentions couldnt have been clearer. Harvest what you can, throw away whats left. So, working in secret with a team of eight writers, we prepared a special Sunday Perspective section on the importance of local news. The Denver rebellion launched like a missile, and went off like a hydrogen bomb. Clearly, we werent alone in our outrage. But as expected, I was forced to resign. And a year later, nothings changed. The Denver Post is but a few lone journalists doing their admirable best in this husk of a once great paper. Now, at least some of you are thinking to yourself, So what. Right. So what. Let this dying industry die. And I kind of get that. For one thing, the local news has been in decline for so long that many of you may not even remember what its like to have a great local paper. Maybe youve seen Spotlight or The Paper, movies that romanticize what journalism used to be. Well, Im not here to be romantic or nostalgic. Im here to warn you that when local news dies, so does our democracy. And that should concern you, And that should concern you, regardless of whether you subscribe. Heres why. A democracy is a government of the people. People are the ultimate source of power and authority. A great local newsroom acts like a mirror. Its journalists see the community and reflect it back. That information is empowering. Seeing, knowing, understanding, this is how good decisions are made. When you have a great local paper, you have journalists sitting in on every city council meeting. Listening in to state house and senate hearings. Those important but, lets face it, sometimes devastatingly boring committee hearings. Journalists discover the flaws and ill conceived measures and those bills fail, because the public was well informed. Readers go to the polls and they know the pros and cons behind every ballot measure, because journalists did the heavy lifting for them. Even better, researchers have found that reading a local paper can mobilize 13 percent of nonvoters to vote. Thirteen percent. Thats the number that can change the outcome of many elections. When you dont have a great local paper, voters are left stranded at the polls, confused, trying to make their best guess based on a paragraph of legalese. Flawed measures pass. Well conceived but highly technical measures fail. Voters become more partisan. Recently in Colorado, our governors race had more candidates than anyone can remember. In years past, journalists would have thoroughly vetted, scrutinized, fact checked, profiled, debated every contender in the local paper. The Denver Post did its best. But in the place of past levels of rigorous reporting and research, the public is increasingly left to interpret dog and pony show stump speeches and clever campaign ads for themselves. With advertizing costing what it does, electability comes down to money. So by the end of the primaries, the only candidates left standing were the wealthiest and best funded. Many experienced and praise worthy candidates never got oxygen, because when local news declines, even big ticket races become pay to play. Is it any surprise that our new governor was the candidate worth more than 300 million dollars. Or that billionaire businessmen like Donald Trump and Howard Schultz can seize the political stage. I dont think this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they talked about free and fair elections. Now this is exactly why we cant just rely on the big national papers, like The Journal and The Times and The Post. Those are tremendous papers, and we need them now, my God, more than ever before. But there is no world in which they could cover every election in every county in the country. No. The newsroom best equipped to cover your local election ought to be your local newsroom. If youre lucky and still have one. When election day is over, a great local paper is still there, waiting like a watchdog. When theyre being watched, politicians have less power, police do right by the public, even massive corporations are on their best behavior. This mechanism that for generations has helped inform and guide us no longer functions the way it used to. You know intimately what the poisoned national discourse feels like, what a mockery of reasoned debate it has become. This is what happens when local newsrooms shutter and communities across the country go unwatched and unseen. Until we recognize that the decline of local news has serious consequences for our society, this situation will not improve. A properly staffed local newsroom isnt profitable, and in this age of Google and Facebook, its not going to be. If newspapers are vital to our democracy, then we should fund them like theyre vital to our democracy. We cannot stand by and let our watchdogs be put down. We cant let more communities vanish into darkness. It is time to debate a public funding option before the fourth estate disappears, and with it, our grand democratic experiment. We need much more than a rebellion. It is time for a revolution. Thank you. "
"As a wildfire rages through the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest flee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank of a crocodile infested river. Fortunately, there happens to be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion or wildebeest on board to row it across the river. Theres just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in, and the results wont be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat when its on a given side of the river. Whats the fastest way for all six animals to get across without the lions stopping for dinner. Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in, 3 Answer in, 2 Answer in, 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make at each point, and the consequences each choice leads to. For instance, there are five options for who goes across first, one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, itll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately get eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions in the same number of moves. For the sake of time, well focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays and the lion returns, there will be three lions on the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion already on the left bank. If two wildebeest go, the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So thats a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now. Well, since weve got two lions waiting on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest to cross. Next, theres no sense in two wildebeest going back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, theyll outnumber the wildebeest on the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal on the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, theres no point in sending the lion wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, theyd eat the wildebeest on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now were quite close because the wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All thats left is for that one lion to raft back and bring his fellow lions over one by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed to get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed from the fire just in time and begin their new lives across the river. Of course, now that the dangers passed, it remains to be seen how long their unlikely alliance will last."
"So Im pretty sure that Im not the only one in this room who at some point have found myself, you know, looking up towards the stars, and wondered, you know, Are we it, or are there other living planets out there such as our own. I guess it is possible that Im then the only person who has obsessed enough about that question to make it my career. But moving on. How do we get to this question. Well, I would argue the first thing to do is to turn our eyes back down from the sky to our own planet, the Earth. And think about just how lucky did the Earth have to be to be the living planet it is. Well, it had to be at least somewhat lucky. Had we been sitting closer to the Sun or a bit further away, any water that we have had would have boiled off or frozen over. And I mean, its not a given that a planet has water on it. So had we been a dry planet, there would not have been a lot of life on it. And even if we had had all the water that we have today, if that water had not been accompanied by the right kind of chemicals to get life going, we would have a wet planet, but just as dead. So its so many things that can go wrong, what are the chances that they go right. What are the chances that the planet forms with at least the basic ingredients needed to have an origins of life happening. Well, lets explore that together. So if youre going to have a living planet, the first thing youre going to need is a planet. But not any planet will do. Youre probably going to need a rather specific and earthlike planet. A planet that is rocky, so you can have both oceans and land, and its sitting neither too close nor too far away from its star, but at the just right temperature. And its just right for liquid water, that is. So how many of these planets do we have in our galaxy. Well, one of the great discoveries of the past decades is that planets are incredibly common. Almost every star has a planet around them. Some have many. And among these planets, on the order of a few percent are earthlike enough that we would consider them potentially living planets. So having the right kind of planet is actually not that difficult when we consider that theres about 100 billion stars in our galaxy. So that gives you about a billion potential living planets. But its not enough to just be at the right temperature or have the right overall composition. You also need the right chemicals. And what the second and important ingredient to make a living planet is, I think its pretty intuitive, its water. After all, we did define our planet as being potentially living if it had the right temperature to keep water liquid. And I mean, here on Earth, life is water based. But more generally, water is just really good as a meeting place for chemicals. It is a very special liquid. So this is our second basic ingredient. Now the third ingredient, I think, is probably a little bit more surprising. I mean, we are going to need some organics in there, since we are thinking about organic life. But the organic molecule that seems to be at the center of the chemical networks that can produce biomolecules is hydrogen cyanide. So for those of you who know what this molecule is like, you know its something that its a good idea to stay away from. But it turns out that whats really, really bad for advanced life forms, such as yourselves, is really, really good to get the chemistry started, the right kind of chemistry that can lead to origins of life. So now we have our three ingredients that we need, you know, the temperate planet, water and hydrogen cyanide. So how often do these three come together. How many temperate planets are there out there that have water and hydrogen cyanide. Well, in an ideal world, we would now turn one of our telescopes towards one of these temperate planets and check for ourselves. Just, Do these planets have water and cyanides on them. Unfortunately, we dont yet have large enough telescopes to do this. We can detect molecules in the atmospheres of some planets. But these are large planets sitting often pretty close to their star, nothing like these, you know, just right planets that were talking about here, which are much smaller and further away. So we have to come up with another way. And the other way that we have conceived of and then followed is to instead of looking for these molecules in the planets when they exist, is to look for them in the material thats forming new planets. So planets form in discs of dust and gas around young stars. And these discs get their material from the interstellar medium. Turns out that the empty space you see between stars when you are looking up towards them, asking existential questions, is not as empty as it seems, but actually full of gas and dust, which can, you know, come together in clouds, then collapses to form these discs, stars and planets. And one of the things we always see when we do look at these clouds is water. You know, I think we have a tendency to think about water as something thats, you know, special to us. Water is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe, including in these clouds, these star and planet forming clouds. And not only that, water is also a pretty robust molecule, its actually not that easy to destroy. So a lot of this water that is in interstellar medium will survive the rather dangerous, collapsed journey from clouds to disc, to planet. So water is alright. That second ingredient is not going to be a problem. Most planets are going to form with some access to water. So what about hydrogen cyanide. Well, we also see cyanides and other similar organic molecules in these interstellar clouds. But here, were less certain about the molecules surviving, going from the cloud to the disc. Theyre just a bit more delicate, a bit more fragile. So if were going to know that this hydrogen cyanide is sitting in the vicinity of new planets forming, wed really need to see it in the disc itself, in these planet forming discs. So about a decade ago, I started a program to look for this hydrogen cyanide and other molecules in these planet forming discs. And this is what we found. So good news, in these six images, those bright pixels represent emissions originating from hydrogen cyanide in planet forming discs hundreds of light years away that have made it to our telescope, onto the detector, allowing us to see it like this. So the very good news is that these discs do indeed have hydrogen cyanide in them. That last, more elusive ingredient. Now the bad news is that we dont know where in the disc it is. If we look at these, I mean, no one can say they are beautiful images, even at the time when we got them. You see the pixel size is pretty big and its actually bigger than these discs themselves. So each pixel here represents something thats much bigger than our solar system. And that means that we dont know where in the disc the hydrogen cyanide is coming from. And thats a problem, because these temperate planets, they cant access hydrogen cyanide just anywhere, but it must be fairly close to where they assemble for them to have access to it. So to bring this home, lets think about an analogous example, that is, of cypress growing in the United States. So lets say, hypothetically, that youve returned from Europe where you have seen beautiful Italian cypresses, and you want to understand, you know, does it make sense to import them to the United States. Could you grow them here. So you talk to the cypress experts, they tell you that there is indeed a band of not too hot, not too cold across the United States where you could grow them. And if you have a nice, high resolution map or image like this, its quite easy to see that this cypress strip overlaps with a lot of green fertile land pixels. Even if I start degrading this map quite a bit, making it lower and lower resolution, its still possible to tell that theres going to be some fertile land overlapping with this strip. But what about if the whole United States is incorporated into a single pixel. If the resolution is that low. What do you do now, how do you now tell whether you can grow cypresses in the United States. Well the answer is you cant. I mean, theres definitely some fertile land there, or you wouldnt have that green tint to the pixel, but theres just no way of telling whether any of that green is in the right place. And that is exactly the problem we were facing with our single pixel images of these discs with hydrogen cyanide. So what we need is something analogous, at least those low resolution maps that I just showed you, to be able to tell whether theres overlap between where the hydrogen cyanide is and where these planets can access it as they are forming. So coming to the rescue, a few years ago, is this new, amazing, beautiful telescope ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array in northern Chile. So, ALMA is amazing in many different ways, but the one that Im going to focus on is that, as you can see, I call this one telescope, but you can there are actually many dishes in this image. And this is a telescope that consists of 66 individual dishes that all work in unison. And that means that you have a telescope that is the size of the largest distance that you can put these dishes away from one another. Which in ALMAs case are a few miles. So you have a more than mile sized telescope. And when you have such a big telescope, you can zoom in on really small things, including making maps of hydrogen cyanide in these planet forming discs. So when ALMA came online a few years ago, that was one of the first things that I proposed that we use it for. And what does a map of hydrogen cyanide look like in a disc. Is the hydrogen cyanide at the right place. And the answer is that it is. So this is the map. You see the hydrogen cyanide emission being spread out across the disc. First of all, its almost everywhere, which is very good news. But you have a lot of extra bright emission coming from close to the star towards the center of the disc. And this is exactly where we want to see it. This is close to where these planets are forming. And this is not what we see just towards one disc, here are three more examples. You can see they all show the same thing, lots of bright hydrogen cyanide emission coming from close to the center of the star. For full disclosure, we dont always see this. There are discs where we see the opposite, where theres actually a hole in the emission towards the center. So this is the opposite of what we want to see, right. This is not places where we could research if there is any hydrogen cyanide around where these planets are forming. But in most cases, we just dont detect hydrogen cyanide, but we detect it in the right place. So what does all this mean. Well, I told you in the beginning that we have lots of these temperate planets, maybe a billion or so of them, that could have life develop on them if they have the right ingredients. And Ive also shown that we think a lot of the time, the right ingredients are there, we have water, we have hydrogen cyanide, there will be other organic molecules as well coming with the cyanides. This means that planets with the most basic ingredients for life are likely to be incredibly common in our galaxy. And if all it takes for life to develop is to have these basic ingredients available, there should be a lot of living planets out there. But that is of course a big if. And I would say the challenge of the next decades, for both astronomy and chemistry, is to figure out just how often we go from having a potentially living planet to having an actually living one. Thank you. "
"My name is Jon Gray. They call me The Dishwasher. I cofounded Ghetto Gastro, a Bronx based collective that works at the intersection of food, design and art. We create experiences that challenge peoples perceptions of the Bronx, the place that I call home. Its a funny thing. I just touched down in Vancouver from Paris a few days ago. We took over the Place Vendome with the Bronx Brasserie. Oui oui, cherie. Its wild, because in Paris, they have this saying, le Bronx, which means something is in disarray or a problem. Thats the Place Vendome. We shut it down one time. This lingo came into play when the Bronx was burning, and movies like The Warriors and Fort Apache still make an impression. Some may disagree, but I believe the Bronx was designed to fail. The power broker was a joker. Robert Moses, instead of parting the Red Sea, he parted the Bronx with a six lane highway and redlined my community. My great grandparents had a home on Featherbed Lane, and contrary to the name, they couldnt get a good nights rest due to the constant blasting and drilling that was necessary to build the cross Bronx expressway a block away. I consider these policy decisions design crimes. Being the resilient people that we are uptown, out of the systematic oppression hip hop culture rose from the rubble and the ashes like a phoenix. Hip hop is now a trillion dollar industry, but this economic activity doesnt make it back to the Bronx or communities like it. Lets take it back to 1986. I was born in the heart of the AIDS crisis, the crack epidemic and the War on Drugs. The only thing that trickled down from Reaganomics was ghettonomics, pain, prison and poverty. I was raised by brilliant, beautiful and accomplished black women. Even so, my pops wasnt in the picture, and I couldnt resist the allure of the streets. Like Biggie said, youre either slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot. Dont get it twisted, my jumper was wet. My shit was wet. But when I turned 15, I started selling weed, I didnt finish high school, the New York Board of Education banned me from all of those, but I did graduate to selling cocaine when I turned 18. I did well. That was until I got jammed up, caught a case, when I was 20. I was facing 10 years. I posted bail, signed up at the Fashion Institute, I applied the skills that I learned in the streets to start my own fashion brand. My lawyer peeked my ambition, so he suggested that the judge grant me a suspended sentence. For once in my life, a suspension was a good thing. Over the course of two years and many court dates, my case got dismissed. Both of my brothers have done jail time, so escaping the clutches of the prison industrial system didnt seem realistic to me. Right now, one of my brothers is facing 20 years. My mother put in great effort in taking me out to eat, making sure we visited museums and traveled abroad, basically exposing me to as much culture as she could. I remembered how as a kid, I used to take over the dinner table and order food for everybody. Breaking bread has always allowed me to break the mold and connect with people. Me and my homie Les, we grew up on the same block in the Bronx, two street dudes. He happened to be a chef. We always discussed the possibility of doing something in the food game for the benefit of our neighborhood. Les had just won the food show Chopped. Our homie Malcolm was gearing up to run a pastry kitchen at Noma, yeah, worlds best Noma in Copenhagen, you know the vibes. My man P had just finished training in I I Italy, Milano to be exact. We decided the world needed some Bronx steasoning on it, so we mobbed up and formed Ghetto Gastro. While Im aware our name makes a lot of people uncomfortable, for us ghetto means home. Similar to the way someone in Mumbai or Nairobi might use the word slum, its to locate our people and to indict the systems of neglect that created these conditions. So what is Ghetto Gastro. Ultimately, its a movement and a philosophy. We view the work we do as gastrodiplomacy, using food and finesse to open borders and connect culture. Last year in Tokyo, we did a Caribbean patty, we do jerk wagyu beef, shio kombu. We remixed the Bronx classic with the Japanese elements. And for Kwanzaa, we had to pay homage to our Puerto Ricans, and we did a coconut charcoal cognac coquito. Dimelo. This here is our Black Power waffle with some gold leaf syrup. Make sure you dont slip on the drip. Here we got the 36 Brix plant based velato. Strawberry fields, you know the deal. Compressed watermelon, basil seeds, a little bit of strawberries up there. Back to the Bronx Brasserie, you know we had to hit them in the head with that caviar and cornbread. We also practice du rag diplomacy. Because, we dont edit who we are when we do our thing. Due to our appearance, we often get mistaken for rappers or athletes. It happened here last year at TED. This dude ran down on me and asked me when I was going to perform. How about now. So you see, weve been bringing the Bronx to the world but now we focus on bringing the world to the Bronx. We just opened our spot, an idea kitchen where we make and design products, create content, and host community events. The intention is to build financial capital and creative capital in our hood. Were also collaborating with world renowned chef Massimo Bottura on a refettorio in the Bronx. A refettorio is a design focused soup kitchen and community center. You see the vibes. The recent outpouring of grief about the murder of rapper and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle is largely due to the fact that he decided to stay and evolve in place, rather than leave his hood. After his death, some may see this decision as foolish, but Im making that same decision every day, to live in the Bronx, to create in the Bronx, to invest in the Bronx. At Ghetto Gastro, we dont run from the word ghetto, and we dont run from the ghetto. Because at the end of the day, Ghetto Gastro is about showing you what we already know, the hood is good. Thank you. "
"Africa is booming. Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled, and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. Its that quick. And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent, 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won, with deaths from malaria down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldnt surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasnt an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors, were actually part of the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate, and you saw that get quicker and quicker, and its been impacting everyone. It doesnt matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. Its just a matter of when the inevitable happens. Among the reasons I think its happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s, the greatest politician in the world was African, but Im meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time, and theyre doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries. And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40. At the same time, our debt levels gone up to 120 and were all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low, governments dont have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And its not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again, in the West, we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. Thats an awful lot of debt. Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP. If theres any continent that can do what China has done, Chinas at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart, if anyone can do what China has done in the last 30 years, itll be Africa in the next 30. So theyve got great government finances, great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this. In fact, they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years. Back in the 70s, no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western led. We hear a lot about China, and they do lend a lot of money, but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada. Ten percents come from India. And theyre investing in energy. Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now. Its the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And theyre investing in telecoms, shopping malls. And this very encouraging story, I think, is partly demographic led. And its not just about African demographics. Im showing you the number of 15 to 24 year olds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago, say youre Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory, by chance. You might choose China, which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line, where theres 200 million young people, and every year until 2010 thats getting bigger. Which means youre going to have new guys knocking on the door saying, Give us a job, and, I dont need a big pay rise, just please give me a job. Now, thats completely changed now. This decade, were going to see a 20 to 30 percent fall in the number of 15 to 24 year olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory. You look at South Asia, and people are. Theyre looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh, and theyre also looking at Africa. And theyre looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050. Now, theres a problem with lots of young people coming into any market, particularly when theyre young men. A bit dangerous, sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic. If you look at the red line here, what youre going to see is that in 1975, just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub Sahara in the mid 1970s. Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories, because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent. Today, sub Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975. They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth. So whats Africa looking like today. This is how I look at Africa. Its a bit odd, because Im an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars, and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when Im thinking about the future, Im actually most interested in Central, Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population, East Africa stands out as so much potential. And Im showing you something else with these maps. Im showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what youll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter. Because what people want is what politicians try, they dont always succeed, but they try and deliver. And what youve got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012, the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all, not just 30 percent. The other guy had to say, Im going to build 50 new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment, and thats giving budget revenues, which is giving governments more money, which is helping growth through education. Its a positive, virtuous circle. But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad. Its, But what about corruption. How can you invest in Africa when theres corruption. And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When youre poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side, youll see the per capita GDP, basically every country with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars, has got a corruption score of roughly, whats that, about three. Three out of 10. Thats not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption. You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest, not to say Im not investing in that continent because theres too much corruption. Now, I dont want to be an apologist for corruption. Ive been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe, not in Africa, actually. But what Im saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing. Now Im going to let you in on a little not so secret. Economists arent great at forecasting. Because the question really is, what happens next. And if you go back to the year 2000, what youll find is The Economist had a very famous cover, The Hopeless Continent, and what theyd done is theyd looked at growth in Africa over the previous 10 years, two percent, and they said, whats going to happen in the next 10 years. They assumed two percent, and that made it a pretty hopeless story, because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s. Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover, and what does that new cover show. That new cover shows, well, Africa rising, because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent. I would like to see if you can all now become economists, because if growth for the last 10 years has been five and a half percent, what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa. Very good. I think youre secretly saying to your head, probably five and a half percent. Youre all economists, and I think, like most economists, wrong. No offense. What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done, and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010. Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually, for the first 20 years, the 60s and 70s, India didnt really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If thats familiar, thats exactly what happened in sub Sahara in the 80s and the 90s. And then something happened in 1980. Boom. India began to explode. It wasnt a Hindu rate of growth, democracies cant grow. Actually India could. And if I lay sub Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story, its remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this, Im saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa, Im saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India, I can draw out some forecasts for the next 30 to 40 years which I think are better than the ones where youre looking backwards. And that tells me this, that Africa is going to go from a USD 2 trillion economy today to a USD 29 trillion economy by 2050. Now thats bigger than Europe and America put together in todays money. Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years. The populations going to double from one billion to two billion, so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next 35 years. And when I present this in Africa, Nairobi, Lagos, Accra, I get one question. Charlie, why are you so pessimistic. And you know what. Actually, I think theyve got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned, yes from the positives in Asia and India, but also the negatives. Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely, the technologies that were talking about here this last week, surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster. And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No, not right now, just 30 seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPods full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change thats happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people, give them the skills that they can take back to Africa, and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa, the 21st century is their century. Thank you very much. "
"What happens when technology knows more about us than we do. A computer now can detect our slightest facial microexpressions and be able to tell the difference between a real smile and a fake one. Thats only the beginning. Technology has become incredibly intelligent and already knows a lot about our internal states. And whether we like it or not, we already are sharing parts of our inner lives thats out of our control. That seems like a problem, because a lot of us like to keep whats going on inside from what people actually see. We want to have agency over what we share and what we dont. We all like to have a poker face. But Im here to tell you that I think thats a thing of the past. And while that might sound scary, its not necessarily a bad thing. Ive spent a lot of time studying the circuits in the brain that create the unique perceptual realities that we each have. And now I bring that together with the capabilities of current technology to create new technology that does make us better, feel more, connect more. And I believe to do that, we have to be OK losing some of our agency. With some animals, its really amazing, and we get to see into their internal experiences. We get this upfront look at the mechanistic interaction between how they respond to the world around them and the state of their biological systems. This is where evolutionary pressures like eating, mating and making sure we dont get eaten drive deterministic behavioral responses to information in the world. And we get to see into this window, into their internal states and their biological experiences. Its really pretty cool. Now, stay with me for a moment, Im a violinist, not a singer. But the spiders already given me a critical review. It turns out, some spiders tune their webs like violins to resonate with certain sounds. And likely, the harmonics of my voice as it went higher coupled with how loud I was singing recreated either the predatory call of an echolocating bat or a bird, and the spider did what it should. It predictively told me to bug off. I love this. The spiders responding to its external world in a way that we get to see and know whats happening to its internal world. Biology is controlling the spiders response, its wearing its internal state on its sleeve. But us, humans, were different. We like to think we have cognitive control over what people see, know and understand about our internal states, our emotions, our insecurities, our bluffs, our trials and tribulations, and how we respond. We get to have our poker face. Or maybe we dont. Try this with me. Your eye responds to how hard your brain is working. The response youre about to see is driven entirely by mental effort and has nothing to do with changes in lighting. We know this from neuroscience. I promise, your eyes are doing the same thing as the subject in our lab, whether you want them to or not. At first, youll hear some voices. Try and understand them and keep watching the eye in front of you. Its going to be hard at first, one should drop out, and it should get really easy. Youre going to see the change in effort in the diameter of the pupil. Intelligent technology depends on personal data. Intelligent technology depends on personal data. Your pupil doesnt lie. Your eye gives away your poker face. When your brains having to work harder, your autonomic nervous system drives your pupil to dilate. When its not, it contracts. When I take away one of the voices, the cognitive effort to understand the talkers gets a lot easier. I could have put the two voices in different spatial locations, I could have made one louder. You would have seen the same thing. We might think we have more agency over the reveal of our internal state than that spider, but maybe we dont. Todays technology is starting to make it really easy to see the signals and tells that give us away. The amalgamation of sensors paired with machine learning on us, around us and in our environments, is a lot more than cameras and microphones tracking our external actions. Our bodies radiate our stories from changes in the temperature of our physiology. We can look at these as infrared thermal images showing up behind me, where reds are hotter and blues are cooler. The dynamic signature of our thermal response gives away our changes in stress, how hard our brain is working, whether were paying attention and engaged in the conversation we might be having and even whether were experiencing a picture of fire as if it were real. We can actually see people give off heat on their cheeks in response to an image of flame. But aside from giving away our poker bluffs, what if dimensions of data from someones thermal response gave away a glow of interpersonal interest. Tracking the honesty of feelings in someones thermal image might be a new part of how we fall in love and see attraction. Our technology can listen, develop insights and make predictions about our mental and physical health just by analyzing the timing dynamics of our speech and language picked up by microphones. Groups have shown that changes in the statistics of our language paired with machine learning can predict the likelihood someone will develop psychosis. Im going to take it a step further and look at linguistic changes and changes in our voice that show up with a lot of different conditions. Dementia, diabetes can alter the spectral coloration of our voice. Changes in our language associated with Alzheimers can sometimes show up more than 10 years before clinical diagnosis. What we say and how we say it tells a much richer story than we used to think. And devices we already have in our homes could, if we let them, give us invaluable insight back. The chemical composition of our breath gives away our feelings. Theres a dynamic mixture of acetone, isoprene and carbon dioxide that changes when our heart speeds up, when our muscles tense, and all without any obvious change in our behaviors. Alright, I want you to watch this clip with me. Some things might be going on on the side screens, but try and focus on the image in the front and the man at the window. Sorry about that. I needed to get a reaction. Im actually tracking the carbon dioxide you exhale in the room right now. Weve installed tubes throughout the theater, lower to the ground, because CO2 is heavier than air. But theyre connected to a device in the back that lets us measure, in real time, with high precision, the continuous differential concentration of CO2. The clouds on the sides are actually the real time data visualization of the density of our CO2. You might still see a patch of red on the screen, because were showing increases with larger colored clouds, larger colored areas of red. And thats the point where a lot of us jumped. Its our collective suspense driving a change in carbon dioxide. Alright, now, watch this with me one more time. You knew it was coming. But its a lot different when we changed the creators intent. Changing the music and the sound effects completely alter the emotional impact of that scene. And we can see it in our breath. Suspense, fear, joy all show up as reproducible, visually identifiable moments. We broadcast a chemical signature of our emotions. It is the end of the poker face. Our spaces, our technology will know what were feeling. We will know more about each other than we ever have. We get a chance to reach in and connect to the experience and sentiments that are fundamental to us as humans in our senses, emotionally and socially. I believe it is the era of the empath. And we are enabling the capabilities that true technological partners can bring to how we connect with each other and with our technology. If we recognize the power of becoming technological empaths, we get this opportunity where technology can help us bridge the emotional and cognitive divide. And in that way, we get to change how we tell our stories. We can enable a better future for technologies like augmented reality to extend our own agency and connect us at a much deeper level. Imagine a high school counselor being able to realize that an outwardly cheery student really was having a deeply hard time, where reaching out can make a crucial, positive difference. Or authorities, being able to know the difference between someone having a mental health crisis and a different type of aggression, and responding accordingly. Or an artist, knowing the direct impact of their work. Leo Tolstoy defined his perspective of art by whether what the creator intended was experienced by the person on the other end. Todays artists can know what were feeling. But regardless of whether its art or human connection, todays technologies will know and can know what were experiencing on the other side, and this means we can be closer and more authentic. But I realize a lot of us have a really hard time with the idea of sharing our data, and especially the idea that people know things about us that we didnt actively choose to share. Anytime we talk to someone, look at someone or choose not to look, data is exchanged, given away, that people use to learn, make decisions about their lives and about ours. Im not looking to create a world where our inner lives are ripped open and our personal data and our privacy given away to people and entities where we dont want to see it go. But I am looking to create a world where we can care about each other more effectively, we can know more about when someone is feeling something that we ought to pay attention to. And we can have richer experiences from our technology. Any technology can be used for good or bad. Transparency to engagement and effective regulation are absolutely critical to building the trust for any of this. But the benefits that empathetic technology can bring to our lives are worth solving the problems that make us uncomfortable. And if we dont, there are too many opportunities and feelings were going to be missing out on. Thank you. "
"So a few weeks ago, a friend of mine gave this toy car to his 8 year old son. But instead of going into a store and buying one, like we do normally, he went to this website and he downloaded a file, and then he printed it on this printer. So this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines is something that The Economist magazine defined as the Third Industrial Revolution. Actually, I argue that there is another revolution going on, and its the one that has to do with open source hardware and the makers movement, because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open source. So you go to the same website, you can download all the files that you need in order to make that printer, the construction files, the hardware, the software, all the instruction is there. And also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers, and theres a lot of innovation happening because its all open source. You dont need anybodys permission to create something great. And that space is like the personal computer in 1976, like the Apples with the other companies are fighting, and we will see in a few years, there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out. Well, theres also another interesting thing. I said the electronics are open source, because at the heart of this printer there is something Im really attached to, these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of powers this printer, is a project Ive been working on for the past seven years. Its an open source project. I worked with these friends of mine that I have here. So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians and a Spaniard, we, You know, its a worldwide project. So we came together in this design institute called the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, which was teaching interaction design, this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things. Well, when you design an object thats supposed to interact with a human being, if you make a foam model of a mobile phone, it doesnt make any sense. You have to have something that actually interacts with people. So, we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use, so that our students could just build things that worked, but they dont have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. So how do I make something that even a kid can use. And actually, with Arduino, we have kids like Sylvia that you see here, that actually make projects with Arduino. I have 11 year old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino thats really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools. So lets look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly, so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this discussion is this example of this cat feeder. The gentleman who made this project had two cats. One was sick and the other one was healthy, so he had to make sure they ate the proper food. So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat, and opens the door and the cat can eat the food. This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer, some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs, and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market. And I like this phrase, Scratch your own itch. If you have an idea, you just go and you make it. This is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics. So one of the features that I think is important about our work is that our hardware, on top of being made with love in Italy, as you can see from the back of the circuit, is that its open, so we publish all the design files for the circuit online, so you can download it and you can actually use it to make something, or to modify, to learn. You know, when I was learning about programming, I learned by looking at other peoples code, or looking at other peoples circuits in magazines. And this is a good way to learn, by looking at other peoples work. So the different elements of the project are all open, so the hardware is released with a Creative Commons license. So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon, like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons. Or, the software is GPL, so its open source as well. The documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the Creative Commons. Just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is Arduino and what isnt. Now, Arduino itself is made of a lot of different open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a 12 year old kid, so Arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly. So you have situations like this, where some people in Chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them, to organize a workshop and to save money. Or there are companies that make their own variations of Arduino that fit in a certain market, and theres probably, maybe like a 150 of them or something at the moment. This one is made by a company called Adafruit, which is run by this woman called Limor Fried, also known as Ladyada, who is one of the heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement. So, this idea that you have a new, sort of turbo charged DIY community that believes in open source, in collaboration, collaborates online, collaborates in different spaces. There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community, and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language, beautifully typeset. Or you have websites, like this one, like Instructables, where people actually teach each other about anything. So this one is about Arduino projects, the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else. So lets look at some projects. So this one is a quadcopter. Its a small model helicopter. In a way, its a toy, no. And so this one was military technology a few years ago, and now its open source, easy to use, you can buy it online. DIY Drones is the community, they do this thing called ArduCopter. But then somebody actually launched this start up called Matternet, where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in Africa, and the fact that this was easy to find, open source, easy to hack, enabled them to prototype their company really quickly. Or, other projects. Im getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over again, so I decided to do something about it. This Arduino project, which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime any of these over exposed personalities is mentioned. Ill show you how I made it. Check this out. Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her, Eh. It should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of Kim Kardashians wedding. Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here is that Matt found this module that lets Arduino process TV signals, he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV, put it together and then created this great project. Its also used, Arduinos used, in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider. Theres some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters. Or its used for, So this is a musical interface built by a student from Italy, and hes now turning this into a product. Because it was a student project becoming a product. Or it can be used to make an assistive device. This is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that youre signing on a display And again, this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell Arduino compatible parts, and you assemble it into a project. Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU, where they met with this boy who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3, so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability. Or you can find it in arts projects. So this is the txtBomber. So you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans, so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages. So, yeah. Then we have this plant here. This is called Botanicalls, because theres an Arduino ball with a Wi Fi module in the plant, and its measuring the well being of the plant, and its creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant. So, you know, this plant will start to say, This is really hot, or theres a lot of, you know, I need water right now. So it just gives a personality to your plant. Or this is something that twitters when the baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks. Or this is a 14 year old kid in Chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter. He has 280,000 followers. Hes 14 and he anticipated a governmental project by one year. Or again, another project where, by analyzing the Twitter feed of a family, you can basically point where they are, like in the Harry Potter movie. So you can find out everything about this project on the website. Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. Its interesting how, in 2009, Gizmodo basically defined, said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter, so it was, a lot changed in between. So very serious project. When the Fukushima disaster happened, a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information that the government was giving wasnt really open and really reliable, so they built this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network interface. They made 100 of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called Cosm, another website they built, so you can actually get reliable real time information from the field, and you can get unbiased information. Or this machine here, its from the DIY bio movement, and its one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA, and again, its completely open source from the ground up. Or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make. Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using Arduino and a few parts. This is a pH probe. Or you get kids, like these kids, theyre from Spain. They learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino to make these robots that play football. They became world champions by making an Arduino based robot. And so when we had to make our own educational robot, we just went to them and said, you know, You design it, because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids. Not me. Im an old guy. What am I supposed to excite, huh. But as I, in terms of educational assets. Theres also companies like Google that are using the technology to create interfaces between mobile phones, tablets and the real world. So the Accessory Development Kit from Google is open source and based on Arduino, as opposed to the one from Apple which is closed source, NDA, sign your life to Apple. Here you are. Theres a giant maze, and Joeys sitting there, and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet. Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important in Italy, and yet very conservative. So we worked with a design studio called Habits, in Milan, to make this mirror, which is completely open source. This doubles also as an iPod speaker. So the idea is that the hardware, the software, the design of the object, the fabrication, everything about this project is open source and you can make it yourself. So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great devices, to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real. But when you have this idea, you know, what happens to all these ideas. Theres, like, thousands of ideas that I, You know, it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations. I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you. But lets start from this example. So, the group of people that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone, and you can display information on it. And they prototyped with an old LCD screen from a Nokia mobile phone and an Arduino. And then, when they had a final project, they actually went to Kickstarter and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make a few of them to sell. They got 10 million dollars. They got a completely fully funded start up, and they dont have to, you know, get VCs involved or anything, just excite the people with their great project. The last project I want to show you is this. Its called ArduSat. Its currently on Kickstarter, so if you want to contribute, please do it. Its a satellite that goes into space, which is probably the least open source thing you can imagine, and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino, you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them. So imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that. So, as I said, theres lots of examples, and Im going to stop here. And I just want to thank the Arduino community for being the best, and just every day making lots of projects. Thank you. And thanks to the community. Massimo, you told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course, that it would take off like this. No. I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what youve unlocked. Well, its the work of a lot of people, so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed. Its just, its difficult to describe this. Every morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that Google Alerts sends me, and its just amazing. Its just going into every field that you can imagine. Thank you so much. "
"Were holding hands, staring at the door. My siblings and I were waiting for my mother to come back from the hospital. She was there because my grandmother had cancer surgery that day. Finally, the doors opened, and she said, Shes gone. Shes gone. She started sobbing and immediately said, We must make arrangements. Your grandmothers dying wish was to be buried back home in Korea. I was barely 12 years old, and when the shock wore off, my mothers words were ringing in my ears. My grandmother wanted to be buried back home. We had moved from Korea to Argentina six years prior, without knowing any Spanish, or how we were going to make a living. And upon arrival, we were immigrants who had lost everything, so we had to work really hard to rebuild our lives. So it hadnt occurred to me that after all these years, back home was still in Korea. It made me ponder where I would want to be buried someday, where home was for me, and the answer was not obvious. And this really bothered me. So this episode launched a lifelong quest for my identity. I was born in Korea, the land of kimchi, raised in Argentina, where I ate so much steak that Im probably 80 percent cow by now, and I was educated in the US, where I became addicted to peanut butter. During my childhood, I felt very much Argentinian, but my looks betrayed me at times. I remember on the first day of middle school, my Spanish literature teacher came into the room. She scanned all of my classmates, and she said, You, you have to get a tutor, otherwise, you wont pass this class. But by then I was fluent in Spanish already, so it felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian, but not both. It felt like a zero sum game, where I had to give up my old identity to be able to gain or earn a new one. So when I was 18, I decided to go to Korea, hoping that finally I could find a place to call home. But there people asked me, Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish accent. And, You must be Japanese because of your big eyes and your foreign body language. And so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian, but too Argentinian to be Korean. And this was a pivotal realization to me. I had failed to find that place in the world to call home. But how many Japanese looking Koreans who speak with a Spanish accent, or even more specific, Argentinian accent, do you think are out there. Perhaps this could be an advantage. It was easy for me to stand out, which couldnt hurt in a world that was rapidly changing, where skills could become obsolete overnight. So I stopped looking for that 100 percent commonality with the people that I met. Instead, I realized that oftentimes, I was the only overlap between groups of people that were usually in conflict with each other. So with this realization in mind, I decided to embrace all of the different versions of myself, even allow myself to reinvent myself at times. So for example, in high school, I have to confess I was a mega nerd. I had no sense of fashion, thick glasses, simple hairstyle, you can get the idea. I think, actually, I only had friends because I shared my homework. Thats the truth. But once at university, I was able to find a new identity for myself, and the nerd became a popular girl. But it was MIT, so I dont know if I can take too much credit for that. As they say over there, The odds are good, but the goods are odd. I switched majors so many times that my advisors joked that I should get a degree in random studies. I told this to my kids. And then over the years, I have gained a lot of different identities. I started as an inventor, entrepreneur, social innovator. Then I became an investor, a woman in tech, a teacher. And most recently, I became a mom, or as my toddler says repeatedly, Mom. day and night. Even my accent was so confused, its origin was so obscure, that my friends called it, Rebecanese. But reinventing yourself can be very hard. You can face a lot of resistance at times. When I was nearly done with my PhD, I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug. I was in Silicon Valley, and so writing a thesis in the basement didnt seem as interesting as starting my own company. So I went to my very traditional Korean parents, who are here today, with the task of letting them know that I was going to drop out from my PhD program. You see, my siblings and I are the first generation to go to university, so for a family of immigrants, this was kind of a big deal. You can imagine how this conversation was going to go. But fortunately, I had a secret weapon with me, which was a chart that had the average income of all of the graduates from Stanford PhD programs, and then the average income of all the dropouts from Stanford graduate programs. I must tell you, this chart was definitely skewed by the founders of Google. But my mom looked at the chart, and she said, Oh, for you, follow your passion. Hi, Mom. Now, today my identity quest is no longer to find my tribe. Its more about allowing myself to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself and cultivating diversity within me and not just around me. My boys now are three years and five months old today, and they were already born with three nationalities and four languages. I should mention now that my husband is actually from Denmark, just in case I dont have enough culture shocks in my life, I decided to marry a Danish guy. In fact, I think my kids will be the first Vikings who will have a hard time growing a beard when they become older. Yeah, well have to work on that. But I really hope that they will find that their multiplicity is going to open and create a lot of doors for them in their lives, and that they can use this as a way to find commonality in a world thats increasingly global today. I hope that instead of feeling anxious and worried that they dont fit in that one box or that their identity will become irrelevant someday, that they can feel free to experiment and to take control of their personal narrative and identity. I also hope that they will use their unique combination of values and languages and cultures and skills to help create a world where identities are no longer used to alienate what looks different, but rather, to bring together people. And most importantly, I really hope that they find tremendous joy in going through these uncharted territories, because I know I have. Now, as for my grandmother, her last wish was also her last lesson to me. It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea and being buried there. It was about resting next to her son, who had died long before she moved to Argentina. What mattered to her was not the ocean that divided her past and new world, it was about finding common ground. Thank you. "
"Have you every had to break your familys rules. Today, Im breaking mine, around money, secrecy and shame. In 2006, on my brother Keiths 40th birthday, he called. Tam, Im in dire straits. I wouldnt ask unless I had to. Can I borrow 7,500 dollars. This wasnt the first time he needed quick cash, but this time, his voice frightened me. I had never heard him so beaten down and shameful, and it was on his 40th birthday. After a few basic questions that we would all ask, I agreed to loan him the money, but under one condition, that as the financial professional in the family, I wanted to meet with him and his wife to see what was really happening. Weeks later, we met at the local Starbucks, and I started right in with the tough love budget conversation. You should sell the house, downsize to something you can afford, sell the toys. And Starbucks. Give up the five dollar a day coffee. You know, all the trappings that we do to keep up with the Joneses. Quickly, my brother and his wife went into a fearsome blame game, and it got messy. I vacillated between therapist and pissed off sister. I wanted them to be better than this. Come on, you two. Get your shit together. Youre parents. Grow up and buck up. After we left, I called my mom, but Keith beat me to it, and he told her that I wasnt helpful. In fact, he was hurt and felt ganged up on. Of course he did. I shamed him with my tough love budget conversation. Two months went by when I received a call. Tam. I have bad news. Keith committed suicide last night. Days later, at his home, I went looking for answers, in his office, the garage. There, I found a stack of overdue credit card bills and a foreclosure notice served to him on the day that he died. My brother left behind his beautiful 10 year old daughter, his brilliant 18 year old son, weeks before his high school graduation, and his wife of 20 years. How did this happen. My brother was caught in our familys money shame cycle, and he was far from alone in this. Suicide rates among adults ages 40 to 64 have risen nearly 40 percent since 1999. Job loss, bankruptcy and foreclosures were present in nearly 40 percent of the deaths, with white middle aged men accounting for seven out of 10 suicides. What Ive learned is that our self destructive and self defeating financial behaviors are not driven by our rational, logical minds. Instead, they are a product of our subconscious belief systems rooted in our childhoods and so deeply ingrained in us, they shape the way that we deal with money our entire adult lives, and so many of you are left believing that youre lazy, crazy or stupid, or just bad with money. This is what I call money shame. Dr. Brene Brown, a well known shame researcher, defines shame as the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed, and therefore unworthy of love and belonging. Based on this definition, heres how Im defining money shame, the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed, and therefore unworthy of love and belonging, based on our bank account balances, our debts, our homes, our cars and our job titles. Let me give you a couple of examples of what I mean. I believe that we all have money shame, whether you earn 10,000 dollars a year or 10 million, and its because we give money all of our power. Heres what it would look like if someone that you love, or you, might have money shame. They play the big shot, always picking up the check, financially rescuing family and friends. They are financially secure, but they live in a state of chronic not enoughness. They drive a Mercedes, but their budget really only can afford a Honda. And theyre looking good at every cost. I know that we can break free from the grips of money shame, because I did. Shortly after my brothers death, the Recession hit. I lost my business and faced bankruptcy. Secretly, I was terrified. I stayed in my home for a year, thinking I did something wrong, told myself, What did you do. What happened. I stayed silent, while all along, I went outside and smiled. Nobody knew. Thats money shame. So what I had to do was let go of the grip that I had on knowing all the answers. I was the know it all in my family, and I had to give up the idea that a new financial plan was the solution. And so just like everything in my life, for me, I was sent a human to help, and I accepted the help, but I had to do major self inquiry about my familys money history and my money beliefs. We have to start having this conversation. Money can no longer be a taboo topic. We have to get honest with each other that were suffering with money issues, and lets get real, we have to stop numbing out our pain. In order to uncover the painful parts of your money story and your money history, you cant be numb. We have to let go of our past in order to be free. Letting go of the past happens through surrender, faith and forgiveness. Debt is the tangible manifestation of not forgiving. If you have debt, youve not completely forgiven your past, so its our work to forgive ourselves and others so that we can live freely. Otherwise, our history will continue to repeat. This is not a quick fix, and I know we all want one, but its a slow wake up. This is another level of work. We have to go higher to get it, to get at it. So try this, follow your dollars. Your money will show you right away what you value. Wheres it going. And then ask yourself. Do I really value all this stuff. And get curious about what youre feeling when youre spending. Are you lonely. Are you bored. Or are you just excited. But theres deeper work that needs to happen. How did you get all these money beliefs to begin with. I call this your money autobiography, and as a money coach, this is the first step I take with my clients. Think back to your earliest childhood money memory. What did it feel like when you got money. Were you excited, proud or confused. And what did you do with the money. Did you run with the candy store, or did you run to the bank. And what did you hear your parents say, and what did you see your parents do with the money. My brother and I heard, More money will make us happy. Every day. More money will make us happy. And we internalized that into the money belief that our self worth was equal to our net worth as we watched our mom live in a state of chronic not enoughness. And she numbed the pain with sugar and shopping. So what did we do. Keith played out my mothers life. He was an underearner, longed to be financially rescued, and he numbed out the pain with alcohol. I did the opposite. I became a high earner, rescuer, and I numbed the pain out with self help books. But what we had in common was our money belief. We both believed that our bank account balance was equal to our self worth. Looking back at the Starbucks meeting with my brother ... he didnt need a budget and my judgment. He needed a breakthrough from his suffering, and he needed my compassion. Keith was not able to be the one to speak up and break our family money shame cycle, so he left me to do the work and share his legacy. Change is difficult, but in my family, not changing is fatal. So I did the work, and I have experienced deep and profound forgiveness, and as I stand here today, I am living on purpose, I serve, and money serves me. It only takes one person in your family to break through the money shame cycle. I want you to be the one. Thank you. "
"Its a Friday afternoon, I have finally finished my workday, and there is just one thing on my mind. I can finally go to the supermarket and get those cookies Ive been dreaming about my whole day. I get to the local store which is near my flat, I get near the aisle where theres bunch of cookies, and Im standing there with a gaze, and I notice theres a little girl next to me. Shes about four or five, lets call her Lucy. And Lucy has that same smile on her face like, All of these are going to be mine. At that moment, I just take one or two packs for myself, she sees how I do this, shes like, Aha, this is how it works. She takes ten of them, puts them in her armpits and victoriously goes to the cashiers office. And you have that sensation theres like ponies and rainbows and the sun is shining and shes going to have a blastly Friday. I gather my stuff, get to the cashiers, and I notice we are in the same queue. Lucy is there with her mom, shes thrown all the cookies there in the basket and unfortunately, as life is, mom takes all the cookies out, just leaves one pack. And when she takes them out, you notice that the sunshine and rainbows slowly start to fade. And thats when Lucy starts to become a bit grim, she becomes a bit angry and starts to say, Wait, wait, hold on there Sparky, whats going on. And then she realizes this is not going to end well, and those rainbows and sunshine turn into rainy clouds and a thunderstorm, and that small sweet Lucy isnt sweet Lucy anymore. She becomes angry and shouts, and yells, Why. Why are you doing this to me. Why. I want those cookies. and so on and starts to cry suddenly. And then theres kind of a fuss around the situation, everybody looks at how the mom is going to react, and at this magical moment, all of you probably know, a magical thing happens. Somewhere from the store, the granny appears. She appears and starts to have an opinion, of course, on the matter. Oh, in my time, things were different. Yada yada yada. Lets pause for a brief moment here. What youve just heard is basically a part of my daily life. Being a medical doctor and a psychotherapist, I hear a lot of stories which people go through. And there is this myth that you have to, as a doctor, distance yourself a bit from patients in order to not get too involved, too attached and so on, which is not quite true. When you are a psychotherapist, you need to actually let yourself feel to some degree, to some extent what the patient feels. How that works is not magic, its simple biology. You have a part of your brain that is called the limbic system, which is responsible for how you feel, where your emotions, yours and mine, reside. And when you have an emotional reaction, its never logical, its neurophysiological, its biology, it could be completely illogical. And when somebody feels something, you can start to feel in a similar manner. To give you an example, few years ago, me and my girlfriend were asked to babysit our friends infant. Lets call him David. David is about eight, yeah, eight months old. We arrive at their place, we go in, and you have like a deja vu feeling, like sunshine and rainbows and ponies. Everything is great, you go in, its going to be a blasty evening. The parents leave, we have a very nice time with David. But the infant who is eight month old is at a very special age. Everythings kind of nice up until one point David notices something. Youre not my real parents, now, are you. At which point, David starts to cry, as babies do. For five minutes. Oh, David, its going to be fine. We just have to caress him, maybe put him to bed. Fifteen. OK, then. Lets change the diaper. Yeah, sure, lets change the diaper. We change the diaper. Twenty five, for Christs sake. Lets feed him. Yes, lets feed him. We feed him. Forty. At this point, you start to have various ideas in your head, like, for example, David. Shut up, David. Please shut up. or that you would just leave him somewhere, or you could just ignore him for the rest of the evening. But you realize you cant do that. An hour. An hour and ten. And I remember so vividly, my girlfriend was holding David in her hands, and hes still crying, Were standing in the doorway, we look at each other, and we realize were screwed. At that moment, what basically happens on a neurobiological level, you cant act out in this instance when you want to shake David, you want to put him away, you want to do something else. But its interesting to notice in yourself how you actually feel. And how I actually felt at that moment was completely helpless, angry, in despair, scared at the same time, I dont know what to do. If you think about it, its the same way how David feels. Hes been abandoned by his parents, bastards left him all alone with these two strangers at home. God knows what theyre doing. So hes abandoned, all alone, helpless, hopeless and scared. And the only thing you can do in this instance is to just be there with him and to feel him and to help him in his feelings what hes feeling. Its interesting, when we start to feel something, how our minds change, kind of to some degree tell us what we actually feel. Every single one of us has been born with a completely different set of a brain, how we experience feelings, how intensively that happens, but we experience all the same feelings. The odd thing is while we are growing up we are taught, mostly by our parents, what feelings to feel and not to feel. Stereotypes exist because to some degree, they are true. If we are very open about things, then if I ask the ladies of the audience youll probably want your men to be emotional, right. I can just, No. Someone said no. No. See. Proves my point. So, to some degree you want him to be emotional, but if youre very open to yourself, you dont want the whole emotional spectrum. You want him to be firm and stable, a man on a high horse, or Mercedes, whatever you prefer. But you dont want that embarrassment, the shame, the fear, the excessive jealousy. You dont want that, do you. The same question would be for the men. You do want your lady next to you to be emotional, right. Of course not. You want her to be on the shy side, maybe be afraid sometimes. Youre going again ride on your high horse and your Mercedes, and save them from despair, but ... good girls dont get angry, do they. You dont like the hysteria, you dont like the anger. These are the stereotypes that are taught to kids already from day one, to basically eradicate some of the feelings that they have. And the more the years go by, you start to actually think you dont feel something, and then you put your feelings somewhere else. You start to think youre angry at somebody else, you start to think youre afraid or ashamed of something else, which is not quite true. To maybe not talk so much broadly and saying everything about you, Id like to share the story about me, how my feelings get in the way of my work. Four months ago, I received one of the worst phone calls you can get. In the evening, when I finished my work, my mom called me and told me those words I was always afraid to hear from her, that my father had passed away. And I remember when I came home, how filled with rage I was. I screamed and I yelled, I broke some furniture in my apartment. And my girlfriend was there to see that thing happening to me. Of course, the funeral goes by and life goes on. Then you start to notice something interesting, that some weeks have passed, and walking on the streets to work, I dont even think about my dad in any way, any shape or form, but Im looking at the people around me, and I notice a feeling in myself. I hate every single one of them. I hate their smile, even hate babies that I see. You start to notice, What the hell is happening to me. You get to work, youre angry at your colleagues. You want to tell them how important it is to cherish relationships, how important it is to do stuff, to do things on time, not to let things go, and so on and so on and so on. Months have passed, and I was asked to do this TED Talk. I was preparing the speech for my TED Talk, and every single time I did it, I realized it is not good enough. This isnt good enough, that isnt good enough. At some point, I even had the idea Im going to cancel this whole TED thing. I called up my mom and said, You know, I think Im going to give up all this TED thing. I dont want to do it. And she said, Why. Well, because, I dont know, because I am going to stand there and dont know what Im going to say and so on. And then it hit me, why I didnt want to be here. Its not because I dont know what to say. I give lectures all the time. I know what I am going to talk about. The reason why I didnt want to be here because I know I would feel something standing right here. What I am actually feeling right now. I notice my heart racing. I notice that Im sad that he is not here. Hes not going to call me after this lecture. I notice that Im angry that thats an inevitable thing of life. At the same time, Im to some degree maybe scared or ashamed. What if I drop a tear while Im talking to you. How awful is that going to look. But I didnt finish the story about Lucy, did I. If we go back to Lucy, Lucys mom couldve done anything. She couldve told her, Thats not how a girl behaves. Look at that granny whos shouting at you. Look at the man, that tall man behind you, he is looking weirdly at you. Im looking what was actually happening. And she didnt just keep silent and not say anything. She didnt devalue her, she didnt condemn her, she didnt do anything of the sort. All she did was to get the groceries that she had, took Lucy on her arms, and I heard her just so vaguely that Lucy continued to tell mom, I want those cookies so badly, and I wanted them. And the only thing Lucys mom said to Lucy was, I know, honey. I know you did. But its OK to be angry, its OK to be sad. And I remember Im walking home from this very simple scene any one of you has maybe already seen. I go in my apartment. My girlfriend meets me. She asks me, Well, how was your day. I said, I started off with a smile on my face, said, I just saw a girl not get any cookies. Shes like, What. Are you OK. Im probably in a psychotic state right now. I said no. I told her the whole story about the store. And at some point I notice that my smile turns into a single tear that I have. She asked me, Why are you crying. Is everything OK. I said No. I miss him, like a lot. And the hardest thing about feelings, actually, is that its easy, to some degree, to think about them in your head. But its much harder to actually express them out loud. And all of my patients every single time ask me one of the same questions, Whats the difference that I tell you that Im angry, Im scared, Im helpless, Im hopeless, Im happy. Whats the difference. And I tell them, This is the difference, that somebodys here, this time its me, who actually doesnt just understand what you are going through, but I feel what youre feeling to a certain amount. Question always is, The experiences we have in life, how will that impact your and my ability to, lets say, be there with somebody and feel these feelings. The same way as David needed somebody to be there, the same way Lucy needed somebody to be there, even I need somebody there to be there for me. And I hope every single one of you has the experience that not somebody understands you, but somebody feels you. Thank you. "
" If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option, which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken. Now most people would answer grilled, and its true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories. However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger. The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines, specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine, or PhIP, which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound. A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells, which can also cause them to metastasize or spread. They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group. Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines. However, no studies exist yet that show how or why. These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens. And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe, which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. Now you might wonder how a 13 year old girl could come up with this idea. And I was led to it through a series of events. I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctors office, which was between the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants. They werent sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken, but they were sued because of Californias Proposition 65, which stated that if theres anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning. So I was very surprised about this. And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken, which doesnt seem very harmful. But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner, and I noticed that the edges of the chicken, which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white. And later in biology class, I learned that its due to a process called denaturing, which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function. So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis, saying that, could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH. So my idea was born, and I had the project set up and a hypothesis, so what was my next step. Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didnt have the equipment in my school. I thought this would be easy, but I emailed about 200 different people within a five hour radius of where I lived, and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me. Most of the others either never responded back, said they didnt have the time or didnt have the equipment and couldnt help me. So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times. However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab, so I could finally start my project. The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab, which is where I extracted the chemicals, changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken. The final stages, when I ran the samples through a high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer, which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken. So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results, because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation. When compared with the unmarinated chicken, which is what I used as my control, I found that lemon juice worked by far the best, which decreased the carcinogens by about 98 percent. The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well, decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent. Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation, but it was nearly negligible. And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range, but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. Another important factor that I didnt take into account initially was the time cooked. And I found that if you increase the time cooked, the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases. So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this, is to, not under cook, but definitely dont over cook and char the chicken, and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater. Based on these findings, I have a question for you. Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life. Now Im not saying that if you eat grilled chicken thats not marinated, youre definitely going to catch cancer and die. However, anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. Is it worth it to you. How will you cook your chicken now. Hi everyone. Im Shree Bose. I was the 17 to 18 year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner. And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant. And shes standing in front of you and shes explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if theyre different colors. Sounds ridiculous, right. But that was me years ago. And that was my first science fair project. It got a bit more complicated from there. My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra. My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects, including a remote controlled garbage can. And then came the summer after my freshman year, when my grandfather passed away due to cancer. And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss. So, armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology, I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15. Good plan. So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab. Got rejected by all except one. And then went on, my next summer, to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas. And that is where the research began. So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people dont know about, or at least dont pay that much attention to. But yet, its the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. In fact, one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One in 100 will die from it. Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today, involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells. Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug, a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. Sounds great, right. But heres the problem, sometimes patients become resistant to the drug, and then years after theyve been declared to be cancer free, they come back. And this time, they no longer respond to the drug. Its a huge problem. In fact, its one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today. So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin. And we wanted to figure this out, because if we could figure that out, then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening. So thats what we set out to do. And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase, an energy protein. So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein, and we saw this huge shift. I mean, on the slide, you can see that on our sensitive side, these cells that are responding to the drug, when we start blocking the protein, the number of dying cells, those colored dots, theyre going down. But then on this side, with the same treatment, theyre going up, interesting. But those are dots on a screen for you, what exactly does that mean. Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell. And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant. And thats huge. In fact, it means that if a patient comes in and theyre resistant to this drug, then if we give them a chemical to block this protein, then we can treat them again with the same drug. And thats huge for chemotherapy effectiveness, possibly for many different types of cancer. So that was my work, and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does, but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness, so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren. But my work wasnt just about the research. It was about finding my passion. Thats why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair, cute picture, right, it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor. And ever since then, Ive gotten to do some pretty cool stuff, from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys. But like I said, my journey wasnt just about the research, it was about finding my passion, and it was about making my own opportunities when I didnt even know what I was doing. It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing. After all, my story begins with a dried, withered spinach plant and its only getting better from there. Thank you. Hi everyone. Im Naomi Shah, and today Ill be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients. 1.6 million deaths worldwide. One death every 20 seconds. People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors. And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. Now these statistics had a huge impact on me, but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year round. It confused me, why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season. With this question in mind, I started researching, and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit. As soon as I realized this, I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients. At first, I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients. But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients. And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health, because that relationship seems so important. So with that in mind, I started researching more, I started investigating more, and I became very passionate. Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation, we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively. For example, volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces. Theyre everywhere. These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant, as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act. Which is surprising to me, because these chemical pollutants, through my research, I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated. So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created. Im going to show it to you on my laptop. And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today, Julie. And all of Julies data has been preentered into my interactive software model. And this can be used by anyone. So I want you to imagine that youre in Julies shoes, or someone whos really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder. So Julies going to her doctors office to get treated for her asthma. And the doctor has her sit down, and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate, which is essentially her exhalation rate, or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. So that peak expiratory flow rate, Ive entered it up into the interactive software model. Ive also entered in her age, her gender and her height. Ive assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels. So any user can come in here and click on lung function report and itll take them to this report that I created. And this report really drives home the crux of my research. So what it shows, if you want to focus on that top graph in the right hand corner, it shows Julies actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar. This is the measurement that she took in her doctors office. In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph, it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate, what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be based on her age, gender and height. So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar, and he says, Wow, we need to give her steroids, medication and inhalers. But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids, inhalers and medication, the doctor turns to Julie and says, Why dont you go home and clean out your air filters. Clean out the air ducts in your home, in your workplace, in your school. Stop the use of incense and candles. And if youre remodeling your house, take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring. Because these solutions are natural, these solutions are sustainable, and these solutions are long term investments, long term investments that were making for our generation and for future generations. Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her. So Im very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants. But before I end my talk today, I want to leave you with one saying. And that saying is that genetics loads the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger. And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research. Because what I feel, is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level, that we cant do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything. But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home, in our own school and in our own workplace, we can make a huge difference in air quality. Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors. And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients, anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general. So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality, better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations. Thank you. Right. Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly. Your Google Science Fair champions. Your winners. "
"I want you to look around the room for a minute and try to find the most paranoid person here, And then I want you to point at that person for me. OK, dont actually do it. But, as an organizational psychologist, I spend a lot of time in workplaces, and I find paranoia everywhere. Paranoia is caused by people that I call takers. Takers are self serving in their interactions. Its all about what can you do for me. The opposite is a giver. Its somebody who approaches most interactions by asking, What can I do for you. I wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style. We all have moments of giving and taking. Your style is how you treat most of the people most of the time, your default. I have a short test you can take to figure out if youre more of a giver or a taker, and you can take it right now. This is the only thing I will say today that has no data behind it, but I am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon, the more worried we should be that youre a taker. Of course, not all takers are narcissists. Some are just givers who got burned one too many times. Then theres another kind of taker that we wont be addressing today, and thats called a psychopath. I was curious, though, about how common these extremes are, and so I surveyed over 30,000 people across industries around the worlds cultures. And I found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking. They choose this third style called matching. If youre a matcher, you try to keep an even balance of give and take, quid pro quo, Ill do something for you if you do something for me. And that seems like a safe way to live your life. But is it the most effective and productive way to live your life. The answer to that question is a very definitive ... maybe. I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring their productivity. I looked at medical students grades, even salespeoples revenue. And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers. The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors than they got back. They were so busy doing other peoples jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed. In medical school, the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like, I love helping others, which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody. And then in sales, too, the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople. I actually reached out to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score. And I asked him, Why do you suck at your job, I didnt ask it that way, but, Whats the cost of generosity in sales. And he said, Well, I just care so deeply about my customers that I would never sell them one of our crappy products. So just out of curiosity, how many of you self identify more as givers than takers or matchers. Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more before we talked about these data. But actually, it turns out theres a twist here, because givers are often sacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better. We have a huge body of evidence, many, many studies looking at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team or an organization, and the more often people are helping and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do on every metric we can measure, higher profits, customer satisfaction, employee retention, even lower operating expenses. So givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately, they suffer along the way. I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers actually get to succeed. So I wondered, then, if givers are the worst performers, who are the best performers. Let me start with the good news, its not the takers. Takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers. If youre a matcher, you believe in An eye for an eye, a just world. And so when you meet a taker, you feel like its your mission in life to just punish the hell out of that person. And that way justice gets served. Well, most people are matchers. And that means if youre a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually, what goes around will come around. And so the logical conclusion is, it must be the matchers who are the best performers. But theyre not. In every job, in every organization Ive ever studied, the best results belong to the givers again. Take a look at some data I gathered from hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue. What you can see is that the givers go to both extremes. They make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue. The same patterns were true for engineers productivity and medical students grades. Givers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Which raises the question. How do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel. I want to talk about how to do that, not just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools, even governments. Are you ready. I was going to do it anyway, but I appreciate the enthusiasm. The first thing thats really critical is to recognize that givers are your most valuable people, but if theyre not careful, they burn out. So you have to protect the givers in your midst. And I learned a great lesson about this from Fortunes best networker. Its the guy, not the cat. His name is Adam Rifkin. Hes a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people. And his secret weapon is the five minute favor. Adam said, You dont have to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver. You just have to find small ways to add large value to other peoples lives. That could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other. It could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback. Or It might be even something as basic as saying, You know, Im going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed. And those five minute favors are really critical to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves. The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture where givers succeed, is you actually need a culture where help seeking is the norm, where people ask a lot. This may hit a little too close to home for some of you. What you see with successful givers is they recognize that its OK to be a receiver, too. If you run an organization, we can actually make this easier. We can make it easier for people to ask for help. A couple colleagues and I studied hospitals. We found that on certain floors, nurses did a lot of help seeking, and on other floors, they did very little of it. The factor that stood out on the floors where help seeking was common, where it was the norm, was there was just one nurse whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit. When that role was available, nurses said, Its not embarrassing, its not vulnerable to ask for help, its actually encouraged. Help seeking isnt important just for protecting the success and the well being of givers. Its also critical to getting more people to act like givers, because the data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent of all giving in organizations starts with a request. But a lot of people dont ask. They dont want to look incompetent, they dont know where to turn, they dont want to burden others. Yet if nobody ever asks for help, you have a lot of frustrated givers in your organization who would love to step up and contribute, if they only knew who could benefit and how. But I think the most important thing, if you want to build a culture of successful givers, is to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team. I figured, you want a culture of productive generosity, you should hire a bunch of givers. But I was surprised to discover, actually, that that was not right, that the negative impact of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver. Think about it this way, one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg just does not make a dozen. I dont know what that means, But I hope you do. No, let even one taker into a team, and you will see that the givers will stop helping. Theyll say, Im surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks. Why should I contribute. Whereas if you let one giver into a team, you dont get an explosion of generosity. More often, people are like, Great. That person can do all our work. So, effective hiring and screening and team building is not about bringing in the givers, its about weeding out the takers. If you can do that well, youll be left with givers and matchers. The givers will be generous because they dont have to worry about the consequences. And the beauty of the matchers is that they follow the norm. So how do you catch a taker before its too late. Were actually pretty bad at figuring out whos a taker, especially on first impressions. Theres a personality trait that throws us off. Its called agreeableness, one the major dimensions of personality across cultures. Agreeable people are warm and friendly, theyre nice, theyre polite. You find a lot of them in Canada, Where there was actually a national contest to come up with a new Canadian slogan and fill in the blank, As Canadian as ... I thought the winning entry was going to be, As Canadian as maple syrup, or, ... ice hockey. But no, Canadians voted for their new national slogan to be, I kid you not, As Canadian as possible under the circumstances. Now for those of you who are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away. How could I ever say Im any one thing when Im constantly adapting to try to please other people. Disagreeable people do less of it. Theyre more critical, skeptical, challenging, and far more likely than their peers to go to law school. Thats not a joke, thats actually an empirical fact. So I always assumed that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers. But then I gathered the data, and I was stunned to find no correlation between those traits, because it turns out that agreeableness disagreeableness is your outer veneer. How pleasant is it to interact with you. Whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives. What are your values. What are your intentions toward others. If you really want to judge people accurately, you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two by two. The agreeable givers are easy to spot, they say yes to everything. The disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly, although you might call them by a slightly different name. We forget about the other two combinations. There are disagreeable givers in our organizations. There are people who are gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have others best interests at heart. Or as an engineer put it, Oh, disagreeable givers, like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system. If that helps you. Disagreeable givers are the most undervalued people in our organizations, because theyre the ones who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear. We need to do a much better job valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early, and saying, Eh, kind of prickly, must be a selfish taker. The other combination we forget about is the deadly one, the agreeable taker, also known as the faker. This is the person whos nice to your face, and then will stab you right in the back. And my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process is to ask the question, Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved. The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down. Givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy, who dont have as much power, who can do them no good. And lets face it, you all know you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone treats their restaurant server or their Uber driver. So if we do all this well, if we can weed takers out of organizations, if we can make it safe to ask for help, if we can protect givers from burnout and make it OK for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people, we can actually change the way that people define success. Instead of saying its all about winning a competition, people will realize success is really more about contribution. I believe that the most meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed. And if we can spread that belief, we can actually turn paranoia upside down. Theres a name for that. Its called pronoia. Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well being. That theyre going around behind your back and saying exceptionally glowing things about you. The great thing about a culture of givers is thats not a delusion, its reality. I want to live in a world where givers succeed, and I hope you will help me create that world. Thank you. "
"The Opposites Game For Patricia Maisch This day my students and I play the Opposites Game with a line from Emily Dickinson. My life had stood a loaded gun, it goes and I write it on the board, pausing so they can call out the antonyms My Your Life Death Had stood . Will sit A Many Loaded Empty Gun . Gun. For a moment, very much like the one between lightning and its sound, the children just stare at me, and then it comes, a flurry, a hail storm of answers Flower, says one. No, Book, says another. Thats stupid, cries a third, the opposite of a gun is a pillow. Or maybe a hug, but not a book, no way is it a book. With this, the others gather their thoughts and suddenly its a shouting match. No one can agree, for every student theres a final answer. Its a song, a prayer, I mean a promise, like a wedding ring, and later a baby. Or whats that person who delivers babies. A midwife. Yes, a midwife. No, thats wrong. Youre so wrong youll never be right again. Its a whisper, a star, its saying I love you into your hand and then touching someones ear. Are you crazy. Are you the president of Stupid land. You should be, Whens the election. Its a teddy bear, a sword, a perfect, perfect peach. Go back to the first one, its a flower, a white rose. When the bell rings, I reach for an eraser but a girl snatches it from my hand. Nothings decided, she says, Were not done here. I leave all the answers on the board. The next day some of them have stopped talking to each other, theyve taken sides. Theres a Flower club. And a Kitten club. And two boys calling themselves The Snowballs. The rest have stuck with the original game, which was to try to write something like poetry. Its a diamond, its a dance, the opposite of a gun is a museum in France. Its the moon, its a mirror, its the sound of a bell and the hearer. The arguing starts again, more shouting, and finally a new club. For the first time I dare to push them. Maybe all of you are right, I say. Well, maybe. Maybe its everything we said. Maybe its everything we didnt say. Its words and the spaces for words. Theyre looking at each other now. Its everything in this room and outside this room and down the street and in the sky. Its everyone on campus and at the mall, and all the people waiting at the hospital. And at the post office. And, yeah, its a flower, too. All the flowers. The whole garden. The opposite of a gun is wherever you point it. Dont write that on the board, they say. Just say poem. Your death will sit through many empty poems."
"This room may appear to be holding 600 people, but theres actually so many more, because within each one of us, there is a multitude of personalities. I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them the mystic and the warrior. I was born into a family of politically active intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family that went something like this, if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones we perceive with our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass. I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school, gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself, I wanna get me one of them. And ever since, Ive been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called the optical delusion of everyday consciousness. So what did he mean by this. Ill show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now, see this strange, underwater coral reef looking thing. Its actually a persons trachea. And those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us. If were blind to this simple biology, imagine what were missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. Theyve made me a proud I dont know it all. Now, when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. Shes concerned about whats happening in this world right now. Shes worried. She says, Excuse me, Im pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now. Ive spent my life as a warrior, working for womens issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazymaking, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. Ive always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic, people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This, he wrote, is the interrelated structure of reality. Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said, The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small. And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of ubuntu, which means I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you. Now, we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with a saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do. And we need to do their work now. Im deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing the other, by the voice were giving to the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles of some of the best selling books from both sides of the political divide here in the Liberalism is a Mental Disorder, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot, Pinheads and Patriots, Arguing with Idiots. Theyre supposedly tongue in cheek, but theyre actually dangerous. Now heres a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you, Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice. Who wrote that. That was Adolf Hitlers first title for Mein Kampf, My Struggle, the book that launched the Nazi Party. The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda, they start like this, with negative otherizing. And then they morph into violent extremism. This is why Im launching a new initiative. And its to help all of us, myself included, to counteract the tendency to otherize. And I realize were all busy people, so dont worry, you can do this on a lunch break. Im calling my initiative Take the Other to Lunch. If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch. Or if youre a Democrat, think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now, if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, I suggest you start more local, because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood, maybe that person who worships at the mosque or the church or the synagogue down the street, or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict, or maybe your brother in law who doesnt believe in global warming, anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears. A couple of weeks ago, I took a conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. Now, on paper, she passed my smoking ears test, shes an activist from the Right, and Im an activist from the Left. We used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated. And you can use them, too, because I know youre all going to take an other to lunch. So first of all, decide on a goal, to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunch mate and I came up with these, Dont persuade, defend or interrupt, be curious, be conversational, be real, and listen. From there, we dove in, and we used these questions, Share some of your life experiences with me, what issues deeply concern you. And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side. My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and Im going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side. What. she wanted to know. Like, were a bunch of elitist, morally corrupt terrorist lovers. Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless, gun toting racists. And we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust, we believed in each others sincerity. We agreed wed speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each others openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other, but we also hadnt pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead, we had taken first steps together, past our knee jerk reactions to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable seeming problems will be found. So who should you invite to lunch. Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, thatll be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch. Will the heavens open and We are the World play over the restaurant sound system. Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow, and its difficult. Its two people dropping the pretense of being know it alls. Its two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Heres how the great Persian poet Rumi put it, Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing, there is a field. Ill meet you there. "
"June 13, 2014 started as a routine Friday in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. Redemption is the largest free public health hospital in the city. We are called upon to serve hundreds of thousands of people. In the best of times it puts strain on our resources. Monthly supplies run out within weeks, and patients without beds would be seated in chairs. That summer, we had a nurse who had been sick for a while. Sick enough to be admitted in our hospital. But our treatment didnt seem to be helping her, her symptoms were getting worse, diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, fever and weakness. On that particular Friday, she developed severe respiratory distress, and her eyes were menacingly red. One of my fellow doctors, a general surgeon, became suspicious of her condition. He said her symptoms were suggestive of Ebola. We kept a close watch on her, we tried to help her. We were treating her for malaria, typhoid and gastroenteritis. We didnt know it, but by then it was too late. The next morning I walked in to check on my patient. I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was filled with fear. I gave her reassurance, but shortly after ... she died of Ebola. For me, her death was very personal. But this was just the beginning. A virtual biological bomb had exploded. But the word spread faster than the virus, and panic spread across the hospital. All the patients ran away. Then, all the nurses and doctors ran away. This was the beginning of our medical tsunami, the devastating Ebola virus that left an indelible scar in our countrys history. I was not trained for this. I had just graduated from medical school two years before. At this time, my total knowledge about Ebola came from a one page article I had read in medical school. I perceived the disease as so dangerous, this one page in essence had convinced me to run out of the hospital, too, the moment I heard of a case of Ebola. But when it finally happened, I stayed on and decided to help. And so did several other brave health care professionals. But we would pay a heavy price. Many persons and health professionals had become high risk contacts. This actually meant 21 days counting to potentially disease or death. Our health systems were fragile, our health workers lacked skills and training. So in the weeks and months that followed, health workers were disproportionately affected by the Ebola virus disease. More than 400 nurses, doctors and other health professionals became infected. Unfortunately, my friend, the general surgeon who correctly identified the symptoms in that first case became one of the casualties. On July 27, the president of Liberia imposed quarantine on the worst affected areas. She closed all the schools and universities and shut down many public events. Four days later, the United States Peace Corps pulled out of Liberia, out of Sierra Leone and Guinea due to Ebola. In August, six weeks after the nurse died, hundreds of people were dying of the disease each week. People were dying in the streets. Over the months that followed, West Africa would lose thousands of people to Ebola virus disease. In August, I joined a team to set up the Ebola treatment unit at JFK hospital in Monrovia. I was charged with running the second Ebola treatment unit in the city. Our unit provided hope for thousands of patients, families and communities. I not only provided care, I came face to face with Ebola. Living every day as a high risk Ebola virus disease contact during the worst of the outbreak was one of my worst experiences. I started counting 21 days every day. I lived every moment anticipating the onset of symptoms of the disease. I measured my body temperature several times. I showered with chlorinated water, more concentrated than actually recommended. I chlorinated my phones, my pants, my hands, my car. My clothes became bleached. Those days you were alone, people were so afraid of touching anybody. Everyone was counted as a potential contact. Touching would make them sick. I was stigmatized. But if that was what it was for me, who was symptom free, imagine what it was for someone who actually had symptoms, someone who had Ebola. We learned that to treat Ebola successfully, we had to suspend some of the normal rules of society. Our president declared a state of emergency in August and suspended certain rights. And the national police even supported our work during the Ebola response. In February 2015, gang members came in for isolation in our Ebola isolation unit. They were also know as the VIP Boys of Monrovia, terrifying small time drug addicts whose presence could instill a tremendous amount of fear, although they could not legally carry guns. They underwent quarantine for 21 days in our unit and were not arrested. We told the police, If you arrest them here, they will stop coming, they wont get treated. And the Ebola virus will continue to spread. The police agreed, and we were able to treat the VIP Boys, and they did not have to worry about being arrested while in the unit. Over the course of the outbreak, West Africa had almost 29,000 cases. More than 11,000 people died. And that included 12 of my fine colleagues at John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia. In June 2016, exactly 23 months after my first Ebola patient died, Liberia declared its Ebola outbreak ended. We thought that once the outbreak ended, so did the problems. We hoped that life would go back to normal. Today, there are more than 17,000 survivors in West Africa. People who actually had Ebola virus disease, lived through it and survived. We counted survival rate as a success, the end of suffering for the patient and fulfilling joy for families. Every discharge from the unit was a moment of jubilation. At least so we thought. The best description of the moment of discharge and a rare glimpse into the moment that defines our life post Ebola was vividly expressed in the words of my best friend and fellow doctor, Philip Ireland, in an interview with The Times. He said at the time of his release, There were a lot of people there from JFK hospital, my family, my elder brother, my wife was there. A lot of other doctors were there, too, and members of the media were there. And I felt like Nelson Mandela, it felt like the Long Walk to Freedom, and I walked and raised my hands to the heaven, thanking God for saving my life. And Philip said, Then I saw something else. There were a lot of crying people, people happy to see me. But when I got close to anybody, they backed away. For many Ebola survivors, society still seems to be backing away, even as they struggle to lead a normal life. For these survivors, life can be compared to another health emergency. They may suffer debilitating joint and body pain. The suffering gradually decays over time for most. However, many continue to bear intermittent pain. Some survivors are blind, others have neurological disabilities. Some survivors experience stigmatization every day, in many ways. A lot of children are orphans. Some survivors experience post traumatic stress disorder. And some survivors lack opportunity for education. Even families can be split apart by fear of Ebola, too. Theres no definitive cure for transmitting Ebola virus through sex. However, there are successful interventions for prevention. We have worked hard on semen testing, behavioral counseling, safe sex promotion and research. For the past year, there have been no cases of sexual transmission. But some male survivors have lost their spouses out of fear they will be infected with Ebola. Thats how families are torn apart. Another tremendous challenge for Ebola survivors is obtaining adequate health care. In theory, Liberias public health services are free of charge. In practice, our health system lacks the funding and capacity to expand care to all at the point of need. Many survivors have waited many months to undergo surgery to heal their blinding cataracts. Few had to relive the traumatic experience, when their blood was retested for Ebola at the point of admission. Some survivors experienced delayed or deferred admission due to limited bed capacity. No bed available for one more patient. This is neither national policy nor officially condoned, but many people are still afraid of the sporadic resurgence of Ebola virus. The results can be tragic. I have seen Beatrice, an Ebola survivor, several times now. Shes 26 years old. Many of her family members became infected, she luckily survived. But since that day in 2014 she was discharged to cheering health workers, her life has never been the same. She became blind as the result of Ebola. In 2014, the baby of a dear friend of mine was only two months old, when both parents and child were admitted in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia. Luckily, they survived. My friends baby is almost three years old now, but cannot stand, cannot walk, cannot speak. He has failure to thrive. There are many more hidden experiences and many stories are yet untold. The survivors of Ebola deserve our attention and support. The only way we can defeat this pandemic is when we ensure that we win this final battle. Our best opportunity is to ensure that every survivor receives adequate care at the point of need without any form of stigma and at no cost to them personally. How can a society consider itself healed when a persons entire identity is defined by the fact that they recovered from Ebola. Should a previous disease that a person no longer has become the sum total of their identity, the identifier in their passport that deters you from traveling to seek medical care abroad. Simply the ID that denies you health care. Or prevents you from having a relationship with your spouse. Or denies you of family, of friend or home. Or prevents you from carrying on your normal job, so you can put food on the table or have a roof over your familys head. What is the meaning of the right to life when our life is clouded by stigma and barriers that fuel that stigma. Until we have much better answers to those questions in West Africa, our work is not over yet. Liberians are a resilient people. And we know how to rise to a challenge, even a devastating one. My best memories of the outbreak center on those many people who survived the disease, but I cannot forget the hard working nurses, doctors, volunteers and staff who risked their own safety in service of humanity. And some even losing their lives in the process. During the worst of the contagion, one thing kept us making those perilous daily journeys into the Ebola wards. We had a passion to save lives. Was I afraid during the Ebola outbreak. Of course I was. But for me, the opportunity to protect our global health security and keep communities safe at home and abroad was an honor. So as the dangers became greater, our humanity became stronger. We faced our fears. The global health community working together defeated Ebola, and that ... that is how I know that we can defeat its aftermath in our hearts, in our minds and in our communities. Thank you. "
"I know a man who soars above the city every night. In his dreams, he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the Earth. Everything has motion, he claims, even a body as paralyzed as his own. This man is my father. Three years ago, when I found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem, I walked into his room in the ICU at the Montreal Neurological Institute and found him lying deathly still, tethered to a breathing machine. Paralysis had closed over his body slowly, beginning in his toes, then legs, torso, fingers and arms. It made its way up his neck, cutting off his ability to breathe, and stopped just beneath the eyes. He never lost consciousness. Rather, he watched from within as his body shut down, limb by limb, muscle by muscle. In that ICU room, I walked up to my fathers body, and with a quivering voice and through tears, I began reciting the alphabet. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. At K, he blinked his eyes. I began again. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. He blinked again at the letter I, then at T, then at R, and Kitra. He said Kitra, my beauty, dont cry. This is a blessing. There was no audible voice, but my father called out my name powerfully. Just 72 hours after his stroke, he had already embraced the totality of his condition. Despite his extreme physical state, he was completely present with me, guiding, nurturing, and being my father as much if not more than ever before. Locked in syndrome is many peoples worst nightmare. In French, its sometimes called maladie de lemmure vivant. Literally, walled in alive disease. For many people, perhaps most, paralysis is an unspeakable horror, but my fathers experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped, but rather of turning the psyche inwards, dimming down the external chatter, facing the recesses of his own mind, and in that place, falling in love with life and body anew. As a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body, life and death, the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him. He realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine. Paradise is in this body. Its in this world, he said. I slept by my fathers side for the first four months, tending as much as I could to his every discomfort, understanding the deep human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help. My mother, sisters, brother and I, we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing. We became his mouthpiece, spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye. His room, it became our temple of healing. His bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us, my father was able to speak and uplift, letter by letter, blink by blink. Everything in our world became slow and tender as the din, drama and death of the hospital ward faded into the background. I want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke. He composed a letter, addressing his synagogue congregation, and ended it with the following lines, When my nape exploded, I entered another dimension, inchoate, sub planetary, protozoan. Universes are opened and closed continually. There are many when low, who stop growing. Last week, I was brought so low, but I felt the hand of my father around me, and my father brought me back. When we werent his voice, we were his legs and arms. I moved them like I know I would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day. I remember Id hold his fingers near my face, bending each joint to keep it soft and limber. Id ask him again and again to visualize the motion, to watch from within as the finger curled and extended, and to move along with it in his mind. Then, one day, from the corner of my eye, I saw his body slither like a snake, an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs. At first, I thought it was my own hallucination, having spent so much time tending to this one body, so desperate to see anything react on its own. But he told me he felt tingles, sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin. The following week, he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance. Connections were being made. Body was slowly and gently reawakening, limb by limb, muscle by muscle, twitch by twitch. As a documentary photographer, I felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn. I photographed him taking his first unaided breath, the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time, the new adapted technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence. I photographed the care and the love that surrounded him. But my photographs only told the outside story of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine. I wasnt able to portray his story from within, and so I began to search for a new visual language, one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience. Finally, I want to share with you a video from a series that Ive been working on that tries to express the slow, in between existence that my father has experienced. As he began to regain his ability to breathe, I started recording his thoughts, and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice. You have to believe youre paralyzed to play the part of a quadriplegic. I dont. In my mind, and in my dreams every night I Chagall man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor. I know nothing about the statement of man without motion. Everything has motion. The heart pumps. The body heaves. The mouth moves. We never stagnate. Life triumphs up and down. For most of us, our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious, but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience. Like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share, he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths and dreams about crawling back home. So begins life at 57, he says. A toddler has no attitude in its being, but a man insists on his world every day. Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has, but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives. I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable, but my father insists that there are no dead ends. Instead, he invites me into his space of co healing to give the very best of myself, and for him to give the very best of himself to me. Paralysis was an opening for him. It was an opportunity to emerge, to rekindle life force, to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation. Today, my father is no longer locked in. He moves his neck with ease, has had his feeding peg removed, breathes with his own lungs, speaks slowly with his own quiet voice, and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body. But the work will never be finished. As he says, Im living in a broken world, and there is holy work to do. Thank you. "
" If I asked you to think of a ferocious killer animal, youd probably think of a lion, and for all the wonderful predatory skills that a lion has, it still only has about a 20 percent success rate at catching a meal. Now, one of the most successful hunters in the entire animal kingdom is surprising, the dragonfly. Now, dragonflies are killer flies, and when they see a smaller fly, they have about a 97 percent chance of catching it for a meal. And this is in mid flight. But how can such a small insect be so precise. In this episode, were going to see how the dragonflys brain is highly specialized to be a deadly killer. So what makes the dragonfly one of the most successful predators in the animal kingdom. One, its the eyes. It has near 360 degree vision. Two, the wings. With individual control of its wings, the dragonfly can move precisely in any direction. But the real secret to the dragonflys success is how its brain coordinates this complex information between the eyes and the wings and turns hunting into a simple reflex. To study this, Jaimies been spending a lot of time socializing with dragonflies. What do you need to do your experiments. First of all, you need dragonflies. Oliver. I have a mesh cage to catch the dragonflies. The more I worked with them, the more terrified I got of them. Theyre actually very scary, especially under a microscope. They have really sharp mandibles, are generally pretty aggressive, which I guess also helps them to be really good predators. In order to learn whats going on inside the dragonflys brain when it sees a prey, were going to eavesdrop in on a conversation between the eyes and the wings, and to do that, we need to anesthetize the dragonfly on ice and make sure we protect its wings so that we can release it afterwards. Now, the dragonflys brain is made up of specialized cells called neurons and these neurons are what allow the dragonfly to see and move so quickly. The individual neurons form circuits by connecting to each other via long, tiny threads called axons and the neurons communicate over these axons using electricity. In the dragonfly, were going to place little metal wires, or electrodes, along the axon tracks, and this is whats really cool. In the dragonfly, theres only 16 neurons, thats eight per eye that tell the wings exactly where the target is. Weve placed the electrodes so that we can record from these neurons that connect the eyes to the wings. Whenever a message is being passed from the eye to the wing, our electrode intercepts that conversation in the form of an electrical current, and it amplifies it. Now, we can both hear it and see it in the form of a spike, which we also call an action potential. Now lets listen in. Right now, we have the dragonfly flipped upside down, so hes looking down towards the ground. Were going to take a prey, or what we sometimes call a target. In this case, the targets going to be a fake fly. Were going to move it into the dragonflys sights. Oh. Oh, look at that. Look at that, but its only in one direction. Oh, yes. You dont see any spikes when I go forward, but theyre all when I come back. In our experiments, we were able to see that the neurons of the dragonfly fired when we moved the target in one direction but not the other. Now, why is that. Remember when I said that the dragonfly had near 360 degree vision. Well, theres a section of the eye called the fovea and this is the part that has the sharpest visual acuity, and you can think of it as its crosshairs. Remember when I told you the dragonfly had individual precise control of its wings. When a dragonfly sees its prey, it trains its crosshairs on it and along its axons it sends messages only to the neurons that control the parts of the wings that are needed to keep that dragonfly on target. So if the prey is on the left of the dragonfly, only the neurons that are tugging the wings to the left are fired. And if the prey moves to the right of the dragonfly, those same neurons are not needed, so theyre going to remain quiet. And the dragonfly speeds toward the prey at a fixed angle thats communicated by this crosshairs to the wings, and then boom, dinner. Now, all this happens in a split second, and its effortless for the dragonfly. Its almost like a reflex. And this whole incredibly efficient process is called fixation. But theres one more story to this process. We saw how the neurons respond to movements, but how does the dragonfly know that something really is prey. This is where size matters. Lets show the dragonfly a series of dots. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it prefers that one. Out of all the sizes, we found that the dragonfly responded to smaller targets over larger ones. In other words, the dragonfly was programmed to go after smaller flies versus something much larger, like a bird. And as soon as it recognizes something as prey, that poor little fly only has seconds to live. Today we got to see how the dragonflys brain works to make it a very efficient killer. And lets be thankful that we didnt live 300 million years ago when dragonflies were the size of cats."
"Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art. Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long time collectors here with us at TED, local collectors, to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know. The first is Bharti Kher. The central motif of Bhartis practice is the ready made store bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads, every day, in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage. But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world. Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it, by exploding it into something spectacular. She also creates life size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals, which she then completely covers in bindis, often with potent symbolism. She says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis, and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand. Our next artist, Balasubramaniam, really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation, working wonders with fiberglass. Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I wont spend too much time on him here today, except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible. Brooklyn based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages, using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. These comics are a fundamental way that children, especially in the diaspora, learn their religious and mythological folk tales. I, for one, was steeped in these. Chitra basically remixes and retitles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics. And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography, sculpture, painting and installation. As you can see, hes heavily influenced by graffiti and street art, and his home city of Mumbai is an ever present element in his work. He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay. He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin. Here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. This next artist, N.S. Harsha, actually has a studio right here in Mysore. Hes putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition. He creates these fine, delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale. He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect, whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore, or in his increasingly ambitious installation work, here with 192 functioning sewing machines, fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations. Mumbai based Dhruvi Acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women. She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas, but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh. In this particular work, she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative. Raqib Shaw is Kolkata born, Kashmir raised, and London trained. He too is reinventing the miniature tradition. He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch, but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. Im kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together. Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today, working across photography, video and installation. They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization, and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work. Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens, in which the city itself may have been the culprit. This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta. He was first known for creating giant photo realistic canvases, paintings of everyday objects, the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally, and on a grander and grander scale, by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations. And finally number 10, last and certainly not least, Ranjani Shettar, who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka, creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial, and brings, like Subodh, the local global. These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. And she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space, and interact with the objects. And light and shadow are a very important part of her work. She also explores themes of consumerism, and the environment, such as in this work, where these basket like objects look organic and woven, and are woven, but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard. 10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in. But I can only hope Ive whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. Thank you very much for looking and listening. "
"In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor were in a fight. It started with a disagreement over the behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation of witchcraft leveled against one of the most powerful figures in the city. Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the citys leaders. In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost mythical status. But while none of Hypatias own writings survive, her contemporaries and students accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately led to her downfall. Hypatia was born around 355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center. Her father Theon was an accomplished Greek mathematician and astronomer, her mother is unknown. Hypatia was likely an only child, and Theon educated her himself. By adulthood, she had surpassed her father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the citys foremost scholar and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, similar to a modern university. She refined scientific instruments, wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient method of long division. But perhaps her most significant contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching. The philosophy Hypatia taught drew from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras. The convergence of these influences merged to form a school called Neoplatonism. For the Neoplatonists, mathematics had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. These subjects were not studied merely for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred language of the universe. In the repeated patterns of algebraic formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational cosmic force at work. Students delved into this ordered mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, known as the One. While Hypatia was considered pagan, a term for traditional Roman belief before Christianity, she worshipped no particular deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside multiple religious viewpoints. Jewish and Christian as well as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of the empire to study with her. The nonpartisan environment Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of Alexandria at the time. Christianity had recently become the Empires state religion. The local archbishop Cyril had steadily gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population. In doing so, he encroached on the secular authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to a bitter public feud between the two men. Because she was seen as a wise and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with fairness and restraint. But when a group of Cyrils monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, he had their leader tortured to death. Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to turn Orestes against Christianity. In March 415, as Hypatia was traveling through the city, the bishops militia of monks dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her. Hypatias death was a turning point in the politics of Alexandria. In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek and Roman tradition fled, and the citys role as a center of learning declined. In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, and fairness she fostered died with her."
"From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him. He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six figure profit, and hed only owned it for five years. The school where he graduated from with his masters had just offered him a teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in ages. And yet, despite everything going really well for John, he was struggling, fighting addiction and a gripping depression. On the night of June 11th, 2003, he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. Remarkably, no, miraculously, he lived. The fall shattered his right arm, broke every rib that he had, punctured his lung, and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River, under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry, where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain, contacted the boats captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital. And thats actually where our story begins. Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together, first physically, then emotionally, and then spiritually, he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail. But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time. This truly is an at risk population with very few resources to support them. And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, were not sure what to say, and so quite often we say nothing. And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. I know Johns story very well because Im John. And this is, today, the first time in any sort of public setting Ive ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide, and sitting last year at TEDActive, I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading, and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help. As the Trevor Project says, it gets better. It gets way better. And Im choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you, to urge you, that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide, or you know somebody who has, talk about it, get help. Its a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. Thank you. "
"Youre on the trail of a werewolf thats been terrorizing your town. After months of detective work, youve narrowed your suspects to one of five people, the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. Youve invited them to dinner with a simple plan, youll slip a square of a rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat just ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose is 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the square into fifths youll have just enough antidote for everyone. Youll have to use a laser cutting tool to cut up the square, every other means available to you isnt precise enough. There are 8 points that can act as starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, youll have to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin and end each cut, and then the laser executes all the cuts simultaneously. Its okay to cut the square into as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them into 10 gram portions. But you cant fold the square or alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot at using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising, and in a moment someone will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote into perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, and save everyone. Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that involve cutting and rearranging, its often helpful to actually take a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what you can get. If we cut BF and DH wed get fourths, but we need fifths. Maybe theres a way to shave a bit off of a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, but that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3 16, just smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead. That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave just a bit more off. Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts, from B to E, D to G, F to A, and H to C, weve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make each triangle can also be rearranged to make a square identical to the middle one. This means that weve split the antidote into perfect fifths. Whats interesting about this sort of problem is that while its possible to solve it by starting from the geometry, its actually easier to start experimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldnt be as viable if the square had, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there are only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, a terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect, and the people and animals of the town can rest a little easier."
"Thank you so much, Chris. And its truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice. Im extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because I need that. Put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane. Ill tell you one quick story to illustrate what thats been like for me. Its a true story, every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the, White House, we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but, I looked in the rear view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. Youve heard of phantom limb pain. This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I 40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoneys restaurant. Low cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who dont know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said Yes, thats former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper. And the man said, Hes come down a long way, hasnt he. Theres been kind of a series of epiphanies. The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way Ive just shared it with you. Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoneys, low cost family restaurant chain, what the man said, they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, Call Washington. Call Washington. And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington. Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. And the story began, Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday, quote, My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant, named Shoneys, and we are running it ourselves. Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on, one of them had me in a big white chefs hat, Tipper was saying, One more burger with fries. Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al. We like to celebrate each others successes in life. I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time. Its a deal. I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on. What can you do about the climate crisis. I want to start with a couple of, Im going to show some new images, and Im going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. Its like beach combing, you know. Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees, last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment, Im kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then Im going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where were projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation, its not a cost, its a profit. The sign is wrong. Its not negative, its positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks, I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. Its an easy, visible target of concern, and it should be, but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But its part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here, there are a lot of people directly involved in this, this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration, thats what CCS stands for, is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do. Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles, buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. Its important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this. Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, Id love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened, with my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click through purchases of offsets. Next, consider making your business carbon neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and its not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, dont ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much theyre going to get paid on your capital that theyve invested, based on the short term returns, youre going to get short term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except its a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow, repurposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and its not just the slides, its what they mean. And its how they link together. And so Im going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and were going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arms length from politics. It doesnt mean that if youre a Republican, that Im trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way its supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions, global warming pollution, and trading it. Heres why, as long as the United States is out of the world system, its not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody whos on a board of directors, how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation. Once its a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem, if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. Its now repetition of short, hot button, 30 second, 28 second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Lets rebrand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse, but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test were facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. Thats really true. I said the other night, and Ill repeat now, this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here, this shouldnt be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. "
"We do not choose where to be born. We do not choose who our parents are. But we do choose how we are going to live our lives. I did not choose to be born in South Sudan, a country rife with conflict. I did not choose my name, Nyiriak, which means war. Ive always rejected it and all the legacy it was born into. I choose to be called Mary. As a teacher, Ive stood in front of 120 students, so this stage does not intimidate me. My students come from war torn countries. Theyre so different from each other, but they have one thing in common, they fled their homes in order to stay alive. Some of them belong to parents back home in South Sudan who are killing each other because they belong to a different tribe or they have a different belief. Others come from other African countries devastated by war. But when they enter my class, they make friends, they walk home together, they do their homework together. There is no hatred allowed in my class. My story is like that of so many other refugees. The war came when I was still a baby. And my father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood, was doing what other men were doing, fighting for the country. He had two wives and many children. My mother was his second wife, married to him at the age of 16. This is simply because my mother came from a poor background, and she had no choice. My father, on the other hand, was rich. He had many cows. Gunshots were the order of the day. My community was constantly under attack. Communities would fight each other as they took water along the Nile. But that was not all. Planes would drop the spinning and terrifying bombs that chopped off peoples limbs. But the most terrifying thing for every single parent was to see their children being abducted and turned into young soldiers. My mother dug a trench that soon became our home. But yet, we did not feel protected. She had to flee in search of a safe place for us. I was four years old, and my younger sister was two. We joined a huge mass of people, and together we walked for many agonizing days in search of a secure place. But we could barely rest before we were attacked again. I remember my mother was pregnant, when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister. We finally made it across the Kenyan border, yes. But that was the longest journey that I have ever had in my whole life. My feet were raw with blisters. To our surprise, we found other family members who had fled into the camp earlier on, where you all are today, the Kakuma camp. Now, I want you all to be very quiet just for a moment. Do you hear that. The sound of silence. No gunshots. Peace, at last. That was my first memory of this camp. When you move from a war zone and come to a secure place like Kakuma, youve really gone far. I only stayed in the camp for three years, though. My father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood, came back into my life. And he organized for me to move with my uncle to our family in Nakuru. There, I found my fathers first wife, my half sisters and my half brothers. I got enrolled in school. I remember my first day in school, I could sing and laugh again, and my first set of school uniforms, you bet. It was amazing. But then I came to realize that my uncle did not find it fit for me to go to school, simply because I was a girl. My half brothers were his first priority. He would say, Educating a girl is a waste of time. And for that reason, I missed many days of school, because the fees were not paid. My father stepped in and organized for me to go to boarding school. I remember the faith that he put in me over the couple of years to come. He would say, Education is an animal that you have to overcome. With an education, you can survive. Education shall be your first husband. And with these words came in his first big investment. I felt lucky. But I was missing something, my mother. My mother had been left behind in the camp, and I had not seen her since I left it. Six years without seeing her was really long. I was alone, in school, when I heard of her death. Ive seen many people back in South Sudan lose their lives. Ive heard from neighbors lose their sons, their husbands, their children. But I never thought that that would ever come into my life. A month earlier, my stepmother, who had been so good to me back in Nakuru, died first. Then I came to realize that after giving birth to four girls, my mother had finally given birth to something that could have made her be accepted into the community, a baby boy, my baby brother. But he, too, joined the list of the dead. The most hurting part for me was the fact that I wasnt able to attend my mothers burial. I wasnt allowed. They said her family did not find it fit for her children, who are all girls, to attend her burial, simply because we were girls. They would lament to me and say, We are sorry, Mary, for your loss. We are sorry that your parents never left behind any children. And I would wonder. What are we. Are we not children. In the mentality of my community, only the boy child counted. And for that reason, I knew this was the end of me. But I was the eldest girl. I had to take care of my siblings. I had to ensure they went to school. I was 13 years old. How could I have made that happen. I came back to the camp to take care of my siblings. Ive never felt so stuck. But then, one of my aunts, Auntie Okoi, decided to take my sisters. My father sent me money from Juba for me to go back to school. Boarding school was heaven, but it was also so hard. I remember during the visiting days when parents would come to school, and my father would miss. But when he did come, he repeated the same faith in me. This time he would say, Mary, you cannot go astray, because you are the future of your siblings. But then, in 2012, life took away the only thing that I was clinging on. My father died. My grades in school started to collapse, and when I sat for my final high school exams in 2015, I was devastated to receive a C grade. OK, I keep telling students in my class, Its not about the As, its about doing your best. That was not my best. I was determined. I wanted to go back and try again. But my parents were gone. I had no one to take care of me, and I had no one to pay that fee. I felt so hopeless. But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, Mary, you have a strong will. And I have a plan, and its going to work. OK, when youre in those devastating moments, you accept anything, right. So the plan was, she organized some travel money for us to travel to Anester Victory Girls High School. I remember that day so well. It was raining when we entered the principals office. We were shaking like two chickens that had been rained on, and we looked at him. He was asking, What do you want. And we looked at him with the cat face. We just want to go back to school. Well, believe it or not, he not only paid our school fees but also our uniform and pocket money for food. Clap for him. When I finished my high school career, I became the head girl. And when I sat for the KCSE for a second time, I was able to receive a B minus. Clap. Thank you. So I really want to say thank you to Anester Victory, Mr. Gatimu and the whole Anester fraternity for giving me that chance. From time to time, members of my family will insist that my sister and I should get married so that somebody will take care of us. They will say, We have a man for you. I really hate the fact that people took us as property rather than children. Sometimes they will jokingly say, You are going to lose your market value the more educated you become. But the truth is, an educated woman is feared in my community. But I told them, this is not what I want. I dont want to get kids at 16 like my mother did. This is not my life. Even though my sisters and I are suffering, theres no way we are heading in that direction. I refuse to repeat history. Educating a girl will create equal and stable societies. And educated refugees will be the hope of rebuilding their countries someday. Girls and women have a part to play in this just as much as men. Well, we have men in my family that encourage me to move on, my half brothers and also my half sisters. When I finished my high school career, I moved my sisters to Nairobi, where they live with my stepsister. They live 17 people in a house. But dont pity us. The most important thing is that they all get a decent education. The winners of today are the losers of yesterday, but who never gave up. And that is who we are, my sisters and I. And Im so proud of that. My biggest investment in life, is the education of my sisters. Education creates an equal and fair chance for everyone to make it. I personally believe education is not all about the syllabus. Its about friendship. Its about discovering our talents. Its about discovering our destiny. I will, for example, not forget the joy that I had when I first had singing lessons in school, which is still a passion of mine. But I wouldnt have gotten that anywhere else. As a teacher, I see my classroom as a laboratory that not only generates skills and knowledge but also understanding and hope. Lets take a tree. A tree may have its branches cut, but give it water, and it will grow new branches. For the child of war, an education can turn their tears of loss into a passion for peace. And for that reason, I refuse to give up on a single student in my class. Education heals. The school environment gives you a focus to focus ahead. Lets take it this way, when youre busy solving mathematical equations, and you are memorizing poetry, you forget the violence that you witnessed back home. And that is the power of education. It creates this place for peace. Kakuma is teeming with learners. Over 85,000 students are enrolled in schools here, which makes up 40 percent of the refugee population. It includes children who lost years of education because of the war back home. And I want to ask you a question. If education is about building a generation of hope, why are there 120 students packed in my classroom. Why is it that only six percent of the primary school students are making it to high school, simply because we do not have enough places for them. And why is it that only one percent of the secondary school graduates are making it to university. I began by saying that I am a teacher. But once again, I have become a student. In March, I moved to Rwanda on a scholarship program called Bridge2Rwanda. It prepares scholars for universities. They are able to get a chance to compete for universities abroad. I am now having teachers telling me what to do, instead of the other way round. People are once again investing in me. So I want to ask you all to invest in young refugees. Think of the tree that we mentioned earlier. We are the generation to plant it, so that the next generation can water it, and the one that follows will enjoy the shade. They will reap the benefits. And the greatest benefit of them all is an education that will last. Thank you. "
"OK, so today I want to talk about how we talk about love. And specifically, I want to talk about whats wrong with how we talk about love. Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives, and in the English language, this metaphor, falling, is really the main way that we talk about that experience. I dont know about you, but when I conceptualize this metaphor, what I picture is straight out of a cartoon, like theres a man, hes walking down the sidewalk, without realizing it, he crosses over an open manhole, and he just plummets into the sewer below. And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping. Falling is accidental, its uncontrollable. Its something that happens to us without our consent. And this, this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship. I am a writer and Im also an English teacher, which means I think about words for a living. You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters, and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love, maybe even most of them, are a problem. So, in love, we fall. Were struck. We are crushed. We swoon. We burn with passion. Love makes us crazy, and it makes us sick. Our hearts ache, and then they break. So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness. They do. And they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances. My favorite one of these is smitten, which is the past participle of the word smite. And if you look this word up in the dictionary, you will see that it can be defined as both grievous affliction, and, to be very much in love. I tend to associate the word smite with a very particular context, which is the Old Testament. In the Book of Exodus alone, there are 16 references to smiting, which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God. Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts. Right. So, how did this happen. How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering. And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims. These are difficult questions, but I have some theories. And to think this through, I want to focus on one metaphor in particular, which is the idea of love as madness. When I first started researching romantic love, I found these madness metaphors everywhere. The history of Western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness. These are just a few examples. Love is merely a madness, from As You Like It. There is always some madness in love. Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love, from the great philosopher, Beyonce Knowles. I fell in love for the first time when I was 20, and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start. And it was long distance for the first couple of years, so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows. I can remember one moment in particular. I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America, and I was watching the person I love walk out the door. And it was late, it was nearly midnight, wed gotten into an argument over dinner, and when we got back to our room, he threw his things in the bag and stormed out. While I can no longer remember what that argument was about, I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave. I was 22, it was my first time in the developing world, and I was totally alone. I had another week until my flight home, and I knew the name of the town that I was in, and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out, but I had no idea how to get around. I had no guidebook and very little money, and I spoke no Spanish. Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity, but I just froze. I just sat there. And then I burst into tears. But despite my panic, some small voice in my head thought, Wow. That was dramatic. I must really be doing this love thing right. Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love. And it sounds so strange to me now, but at 22, I longed to have dramatic experiences, and in that moment, I was irrational and furious and devastated, and weirdly enough, I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me. I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy, because I thought that that was how love worked. This really should not be surprising, considering that according to Wikipedia, there are eight films, 14 songs, two albums and one novel with the title Crazy Love. About half an hour later, he came back to our room. We made up. We spent another mostly happy week traveling together. And then, when I got home, I thought, That was so terrible and so great. This must be a real romance. I expected my first love to feel like madness, and of course, it met that expectation very well. But loving someone like that, as if my entire well being depended on him loving me back, was not very good for me or for him. But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual. Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love. In fact, there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal, because, neurochemically speaking, romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished. This is true. This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder. Yes, and low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression. So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors. And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way. Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love, which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain. And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love. But the good news is, it doesnt always last that long, usually from a few months to a couple of years. When I got back from my trip to South America, I spent a lot of time alone in my room, checking my email, desperate to hear from the guy I loved. I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction, then I did not need their friendship. So I stopped hanging out with most of them. And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life. But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable, because if I could be miserable, then I would prove how much I loved him. And if I could prove it, then we would have to end up together eventually. This is the real madness, because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward, but we talk about love as if this is true. Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural. Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain, and it tells us that love is painful when, after a fight or a breakup, that neurochemical reward is withdrawn. And in fact, and maybe youve heard this, neurochemically speaking, going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal, which I find reassuring. And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love. In this case, were talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness. Its kind of an interesting feedback loop. Love is powerful and at times painful, and we express this in our words and stories, but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful. Whats interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy. It seems like we want it both ways, we want love to feel like madness, and we want it to last an entire lifetime. That sounds terrible. To reconcile this, we need to either change our culture or change our expectations. So, imagine if we were all less passive in love. If we were more assertive, more open minded, more generous and instead of falling in love, we stepped into love. I know that this is asking a lot, but Im not actually the first person to suggest this. In their book, Metaphors We Live By, linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma, which is to change our metaphors. They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world, and that they can even act as a guide for future actions, like self fulfilling prophecies. Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love, love as a collaborative work of art. I really like this way of thinking about love. Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments, which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of, or ideas contained within, a given metaphor. And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails, effort, compromise, patience, shared goals. These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long term romantic commitment, but they also work well for other kinds of relationships, short term, casual, polyamorous, non monogamous, asexual, because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone. So if love is a collaborative work of art, then love is an aesthetic experience. Love is unpredictable, love is creative, love requires communication and discipline, it is frustrating and emotionally demanding. And love involves both joy and pain. Ultimately, each experience of love is different. When I was younger, it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love, that I didnt have to just accept whatever love offered. When 14 year old Juliet first meets, or, when 14 year old Juliet cannot be with Romeo, whom she has met four days ago, she does not feel disappointed or angsty. Where is she. She wants to die. Right. And just as a refresher, at this point in the play, act three of five, Romeo is not dead. Hes alive, hes healthy, hes just been banished from the city. I understand that 16th century Verona is unlike contemporary North America, and yet when I first read this play, also at age 14, Juliets suffering made sense to me. Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire, rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent, is empowering. Its still hard. Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days, and when I feel really frustrated, I have to remind myself, my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together. This isnt easy, either. But its just so much better than the alternative, which is that thing that feels like madness. This version of love is not about winning or losing someones affection. Instead, it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult, which sounds so simple, but is actually a kind of revolutionary, radical act. This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what youre gaining or losing in your relationship, and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer. This version of love allows us to say things like, Hey, were not very good collaborators. Maybe this isnt for us. Or, That relationship was shorter than I had planned, but it was still kind of beautiful. The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself. This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like. Thank you. "
"My wife is pregnant right now with our first child, and when people see her with her big baby bump, the first question people ask, almost without fail, is, Is it a boy or is it a girl. Now, there are some assumptions behind that question that we take for granted because of our familiarity with our own human biology. For human babies, we take it for granted that theres a 50 50 chance of either answer, boy or girl. But why is it that way. Well, the answer depends on the sex determination system that has evolved for our species. You see, for most mammals, the sex of a baby is determined genetically with the XY chromosome system. Mammals have a pair of sex chromosomes, one passed down from mom, and one from dad. A pair of Xs gives us a girl, and an X and a Y together gives us a boy. Since females only have Xs to pass on in their egg cells, and males can give either an X or a Y in their sperm cells, the sex is determined by the father and the chance of producing a male or a female is 50 50. This system has worked well for mammals, but throughout the tree of life, we can see other systems that have worked just as well for other animals. There are other groups of animals that also have genetic sex determination, but their systems can be pretty different from ours. Birds and some reptiles have their sex genetically determined, but instead of the sex being determined by dad, their sex is determined by mom. In those groups, a pair of Z sex chromosomes produces a male, so these males only have Zs to give. However, in these animals, one Z and one W chromosome together, as a pair, produces a female. In this system, the chance of a male or a female is still 50 50, it just depends on whether mom puts a Z or a W into her egg. Certain groups have taken genetic sex determination in completely other directions. Ants, for example, have one of the most interesting systems for determining sex, and because of it, if you are a male ant, you do not have a father. In an ant colony, there are dramatic divisions of labor. There are soldiers that defend the colony, there are workers that collect food, clean the nest and care for the young, and theres a queen and a small group of male reproductives. Now, the queen will mate and then store sperm from the males. And this is where the system gets really interesting. If the queen uses the stored sperm to fertilize an egg, then that egg will grow up to become female. However, if she lays an egg without fertilizing it, then that egg will still grow up to be an ant, but it will always be a male. So you see, its impossible for male ants to have fathers. And male ants live their life like this, with only one copy of every gene, much like a walking sex cell. This system is called a haplodiploid system, and we see it not only in ants, but also in other highly social insects like bees and wasps. Since our own sex is determined by genes, and we do know of these other animals that have their sex determined by genes, its easy to assume that for all animals the sex of their babies still must be determined by genetics. However, for some animals, the question of whether it will be a boy or a girl has nothing to do with genes at all, and it can depend on something like the weather. These are animals like alligators and most turtles. In these animals, the sex of an embryo in a developing egg is determined by the temperature. In these species, the sex of the baby is not yet determined when the egg is laid, and it remains undetermined until sometime in the middle of the overall development period, when a critical time is reached. And during this time, the sex is completely determined by temperature in the nest. In painted turtles, for example, warm temperatures above the critical temperature will produce females within the eggs, and cool temperatures will produce a male. Im not sure who came up with this mnemonic, but you can remember that when it comes to painted turtles, they are all hot chicks and cool dudes. For some tropical fish, the question of will it be a boy or will it be a girl isnt settled until even later in life. You see, clownfish all start out their lives as males, However, as they mature, they become female. They also spend their lives in small groups with a strict dominance hierarchy where only the most dominant male and female reproduce. And amazingly, if the dominant female in the group dies, the largest and most dominant male will then quickly become female and take her place, and all of the other males will move up one rank in the hierarchy. In another very different ocean animal, the green spoonworm, the sex of the babies is determined by a completely different aspect of the environment. For this species, it is simply a matter of where a larva happens to randomly fall on the sea floor. If a larva lands on the open sea floor, then it will become a female. But if it lands on top of a female, then it will become a male. So for some species, the question of boy or girl is answered by genetics. For others, its answered by the environment. And for others still, they dont even bother with the question at all. Take whiptail lizards, for example. For those desert lizards, the answer is easy. Its a girl. Its always a girl. They are a nearly all female species, and although they still lay eggs, these eggs hatch out female clones of themselves. So will it be a girl or will it be a boy. Throughout the entire animal kingdom, it does really all depend on the system of sex determination. For humans, that system is a genetic XY system. And for me and my wife, we found out its going to be a baby boy. "
"Im a biological oceanographer. I have the absolute privilege of studying microbial lives in the Pacific Ocean. So well talk about microbes in a minute, but I first want to give you a sense of place, a sense of scale. The Pacific Ocean is our largest, deepest ocean basin. It covers 60 million square miles. If you took all the continents and you put them together in a little Pangaea 2.0, theyd fit snug inside the Pacific, with room to spare. Its a massive ecosystem, from the blues of the open ocean to the green of the continental margins. In this place, I get to study the base of the food web, plankton. Now, in my research, and really in the field of microbial oceanography as a whole, theres a theme that has emerged, and that theme is change. These microbial ecosystems are changing in real and measurable ways, and it is not that hard to see it. Oceans cover 70 percent of our planet, so ocean change is planetary change, and it all starts with microbes. Now, I have two vignettes to share with you, and these are meant to be love stories to microbes. But Ill be honest that theres an aspect of it thats just a total bummer, and, beware, focus on the love. Right. Thats where Im coming from. So the first thing to know is that the forests of the sea are microbial. And what I mean by that is that, by and large, plants in the open ocean are microscopic, and they are much more abundant than we realize. So Im going to show you some mug shots of these organisms that Ive collected over the years. These are the lowest rungs of the ocean food web. These are tiny plants and animals that come in a variety of shapes and sizes and colors and metabolisms. There are hundreds of thousands in a single milliliter of seawater. You are definitely swimming with them when youre in the ocean. They produce oxygen, they consume CO2, and they form the base of the food web on which every other form of ocean life is reliant. Now, Ive spent about 500 days of my scientific life at sea, and a lot more in front of a computer or in the lab, so I feel compelled to tell you some of their stories. Lets start in the Pacific Northwest. This place is green. It is beautiful. These are blooms of phytoplankton that you can see from space along the West Coast of the United States. Its an incredibly productive ecosystem. This is where you go to salmon fish, halibut fish, whale watch. Its a beautiful part of our country. And here, for 10 years, among other things, I studied the uplifting topic of harmful algal blooms. These are blooms of toxin producing phytoplankton that can contaminate food webs and accumulate in shellfish and fish that are harvested for human consumption. We were trying to understand why they bloom, where they bloom, when they bloom, so we could manage these harvests and protect human health. Now, the problem is the oceans a moving target and, much like some people in our lives, toxicity varies among the plankton. Alright. So, to get around these challenges, we combined satellite remote sensing with drones and gliders, regular sampling of the surf zone and a lot of time at sea in small boats off the Oregon coast. And I dont know if many of you have had the opportunity to do that, but it is not easy. Heres some poor students. Ive hidden their faces to protect their identities. This is a challenging place. So this is hard won data Im about to talk about, OK. So by combining all of our data with our collaborators, we had 20 year time series of toxins and phytoplankton cell counts. And that allowed us to understand the patterns of these blooms and to build models to predict them. And what we found was that the risk of harmful algal blooms was tightly linked to aspects of climate. Now when I say climate, I dont mean weather day to day, I mean long term changes. These oscillations that you may have heard of, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Nino, they usually bring warm, dry winters to this region, but they also reduce the strength of the California Current, which runs from the north to the south along the Pacific Northwest, and they warm the coastal ocean. These are the reds youre seeing in this plot, warm anomalies, strong positive indices of the PDO. And when we have these changes in circulation and changes in temperature, the risk of harmful algal blooms is increased, but also salmon recruitment has decreased, and we see intrusions of invasive species like green crab. So these are ecological and economic impacts of climate. Now, if our models are right, the frequency and severity of these events are only going to get worse, right along with these warm anomalies. And, to illustrate that, 2014 was probably one of the worst harmful algal blooms in Oregon history. It was also the hottest year in the modern climate record at that time, that is until 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. In fact, the five hottest years in the modern climate record have been the last five. That bodes really well for harmful algal blooms and poorly for ecosystem health. Now, you may not care about shellfish, but these changes impact economically important fisheries, like crab and salmon, and they can impact the health of marine mammals like whales. And that might matter a little bit more. That might resonate. So, theres your doomsday tale for the margins of the Pacific. Actually, these are really resilient ecosystems. They can absolutely bounce back if we give them a chance. The point is not to ignore the changes that were seeing, which brings me to my second vignette. I have since moved to the most remote island chain on our planet, the Hawaiian Islands, where Im the new lead of a program called the Hawaiian Ocean Time series. And this is a program that for 31 years has made this monthly pilgrimage to a spot called Station ALOHA. Its in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in the center of this vast, swirling system of currents that we call the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Its our largest ocean ecosystem. Its four times the size of the Amazon rain forest. It is warm, in a good way. It is blue water, its absolutely the type of place you want to dive in and swim. You cannot do that off of research boats, because, you know, sharks. Google it. This is a beautiful place. And here, since October of 1988, generations of researchers have made these monthly pilgrimages. We study the biology, the chemistry, the physics of the open ocean. Weve measured the temperature from the surface to the seafloor. Weve tracked the currents, traced the waves. People have discovered new organisms here. People have created vast genomic libraries that have revolutionized what we think about the diversity of marine microorganisms. Its not just a place of discovery, but the important part about time series are that they provide us a sense of history, a sense of context. And in 30 years of data, its allowed us to separate the seasonal change and see the emergence of humanitys fingerprints on the natural world. Theres another iconic time series in Hawaii, and that is the Keeling Curve. I hope you have all seen this. This time series has documented the rapid increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Its not just the number, its the rate of increase. The rate of carbon dioxide increase in our atmosphere is unprecedented for our planet. And that has consequences for our oceans. In fact, oceans absorb about 90 percent of the heat thats generated by greenhouse gas emissions and about 40 percent of the carbon dioxide. And we have been able to measure that at Station ALOHA. Each one of these dots is a cruise. It represents peoples lives over 30 years trying to make these measurements, and it took 30 years to be able to see this. CO2 rises in the atmosphere, CO2 rises in the ocean. Thats the red line. A consequence of that is a fundamental change in the chemistry of seawater, a decline in pH, pH is on a log scale, heres your blue line. So weve seen a 30 percent decline in pH in the surface ocean in this time series. Now that has impacts for organisms that need to feed, build shells, that changes growth rates, metabolic interactions, and it doesnt just impact plankton, it impacts ecosystems as large as coral reefs. Now one of the things weve been able to show in this time series is this is just skimming the surface. Increases in CO2 and a decline in pH are measured over the top 500 meters of the water column. I really find that to be profound. This is genuinely one of the most remote places on our planet, and weve impacted the top 500 meters of the water column. Now, these two things, harmful algal blooms, ocean acidification, thats not all, of course. Youve heard of the rest, sea level rise, eutrophication, melting of the polar ice caps, expansion of oxygen minimum zones, pollution, loss of biodiversity, overfishing. Its hard for me to get a grad student, you can see this pitch is a difficult one, right. Again, I think these systems, these microbial ecosystems, are immensely resilient. We just cannot go too far down this path. I personally believe that sustained observation of our oceans and our planet is the moral imperative for our generation of scientists. We are bearing witness to the changes that are being inflicted upon our natural communities, and by doing so, it provides us the opportunity to adapt and enact global change, if were willing. So the solutions to these problems are multitiered. It involves a portfolio of solutions, local change, but all the way up to voting for people who will protect our environment on a global scale. Lets bring it back to the love. Microbes matter. These organisms are small, abundant, ancient, and they are critical to sustaining our population and our planet. Yet we are on track to double our carbon dioxide emissions in the next 50 years, so the analogy that I use for that is like we are eating like were still in our 20s, assuming there will be no consequences, but Im a woman in her 40s, I know there are consequences for my fuel consumption. Right. These oceans are very much alive. These ecosystems have not collapsed. Well, except for the Arctic, we can talk about that. But the sustained observations that Ive shared with you today, the work of generations of scientists, are pointing us to take better care of our oceans and to nurture the microbes that sustain us. And on that note, I want to end with a quote from one of my heroes, Jane Lubchenco. And this slide is appropriate. Jane has said that the oceans are not too big to fail, nor are they too big to fix, but the oceans are too big to ignore. Thank you. "
"Im Chris Nowinski, and odds are if youve met me in the last five years Ive asked you, after a few minutes, a bit of an odd question. Can I have your brain. Now, it only seems like a strange question if you dont know my story so please let me share it with you. I grew up outside of Chicago, and I was an athlete and I was very lucky to get recruited to play football at Harvard University. So thats me. And then after graduating, like most Harvard graduates, I decided I wanted to join the WWE. So thats also me. Sure you remember me from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003, and I had a blast playing what people affectionately like to call Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob. It was perfect for me. But unfortunately, I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley, and I suffered a severe concussion. And it led to what became permanent postconcussion symptoms, constant headaches, inability to sleep, depression, feeling in a fog. And in that first year, I tried to figure out how could I make this pain go away. And I wasnt getting the answers I needed from doctors, and so I started digging into the medical literature. And I found theres this whole story about concussions that we werent really being told. So I decided to write a book about it, called Footballs Concussion Crisis that came out in 2006. But in that process, I learned its not really just about concussions. I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. What we used to call punch drunk, because we only knew about it from boxers. We knew that getting hit in the head too many times with boxers would cause their brain to essentially start to rot, to degenerate. And theyd have symptoms like memory problems and problems with cognition, depression, impulse control issues, aggression. So basically, I got ... I got injured at the right time, in which the first two NFL players were studied for this disease. And it turned out they both had it. The first was Mike Webster, 50 years old, already had dementia. The second, Terry Long, 45 years old when he took his life. The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided to look at their brains and found this disease. I wrote a chapter about it, and I thought people would make a big deal out of it. But shockingly, even when the first two cases came in positive, there was never a national news story about this, whats going on in football with these cases of CTE. So the book comes out, not a whole lot is happening, and one day I read the newspaper, November 20, 2006. I find out that Andre Waters just took his life. Those of you who know football, Andre Waters was someone I grew up watching. Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety, years old, a Division II football coach when he decided to put a gun to his head. In the article they reminded me, his nickname was Dirty Waters. He was known for leading with his head, so I thought Im just going to look up did he ever talk about the concussions he had. And I found a quote from 1994 where Andre Waters said, I stopped counting my concussions at 15. I wouldnt say anything, Id just sniff smelling salts and go back out there. And I thought, I wonder if he might have CTE, too. If that might have contributed to whatever made him choose to end his life. So I ended up calling the doctor who did the first two studies, and I said, Hey, I think you should study Andre Waters. And he said, Id be happy to. The problem is, the first two cases died in the county in which I work, and I could study them as part of my job. I cant do that with Andre Waters, he died in Florida. If you want me to study him, youre going to have to figure out how to get me the brain. So I said, OK. How does one get a brain. So I racked my brain and I thought, why dont I call the medical examiner who I think has the brain right now. So I called up the medical examiner in Florida, and I said, Hey, you dont know me, but do you still have the brain of Andre Waters. And he said, Yes, I do. I said, OK, are you going to study him for CTE. And he said no, in fact at that time he didnt believe that was a real disease. I said, OK, if youre not, do you mind if I have it. And he said, Well, young man, I cant give you the brain. You need his familys permission. But if you do get the permission of his next of kin, I will release the brain to you. And I said, Great. And then I realized I had to figure out who his next of kin was and ask them, and it turned out it was Andre Waterss 88 year old mother. And I sat there, and I took a breath and I thought, Am I really going to cold call an 88 year old grieving mother who just lost her son to suicide. And almost everything in me said, Dont do it. Its too much to put this poor woman through, shes been through so much already. But then this other voice in my head said, You know what. If guys are killing themselves from this disease and we could study it to maybe prevent this from happening in the future, sometimes youve just got to suck it up and do something thats very hard. So I called her. First time, nobody answered. Second time, no one answered, third... no voice mails. The fifth time, I got an answer. And thank God that Andre Waterss family was so gracious about the call and said, You know what, we want to know what happened to Andre. We want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life. And so we studied the brain, and it turned out that he did have CTE. He became the third NFL player diagnosed with the disease. This is what it looks like. He was somewhere between mild and severe. OK, we have three of three NFL players here. Maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious. Maybe somethings happening here. So I ended up starting the Concussion Legacy Foundation, actually formalized the work, so it wasnt just some guy calling for brains. And I searched the world. And I put together the best research team I could find. So we partnered with Boston University, we partnered with scientists at the VA here in Boston, and we started a brain bank. Turns out, if you want to know how to cure degenerative brain disease, you have to start by actually studying the brains. At this point, we were the first center in the world focused on CTE. It just had not been studied formally. And so we start this brain bank, and its my job to get the brains for Dr. Ann McKee and her brain bank, right in the middle. We also work with Dr. Bob Stern, Dr. Robert Cantu, truly my dream team of scientists that I support. So my job is to get the brains. And I was very successful in those early years. Since 2007 Ive started every day by reading the obituaries. And its a tough way to live. And its hard on me and its even worse on these poor families that Ive been calling for the last 10 years, to ask for their brains. And so early on in the process, as it started to really eat away at me, I decided, you know what, can I find another way to get people to donate their brains to this research. And I figured out, what if we could create a culture of brain donation in this country. What if it became normal for athletes to donate their brain after they died. And so what I started was a brain donation registry. And I started asking athletes if they would publicly pledge to donate their brain to science. And it started with, actually, a hockey player in 2009. One of my first pledges was a former Harvard hockey player, Noah Welch, who was in the NHL at the time. It was a slow start people understanding what this was about. So when the news hit the front page, Noah Welch pledging his brain to science, he said he went to the locker room the next day, one of his teammates pulled him aside and said, Hey, I heard youre donating your brain to science. And he said, Yep. And he said, Wow. How many games are you going to miss. True story. But weve been remarkably successful, over 2,500 athletes have signed up. They get a brain donation card they keep in their wallet. This is mine, I was obviously first, it says 01. And I will donate my brain to this. Weve also been lucky to have people like Brandi Chastain, the womens soccer icon, NASCARs Dale Earnhardt Jr. Just two weeks ago, Hall of Famer Nick Buoniconti who had been diagnosed with dementia, signed up to pledge his brain. So its been wonderful, and the great thing about it is that it has worked in changing how were able to get brains. So now, instead of me having to call, more families call us. And our phones ring off the hook. And so I can now focus on taking this information, figuring out how do we work towards a cure, how do we work towards prevention, and so my life has gotten a lot easier. This is just some of the headlines that weve able to get over the years from athletes pledging their brain. The problem has been what we learned. So when we started this, only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that had been studied in brain banks. Since then, we have acquired 500 brains and found over 300 of them had CTE. To put that in perspective, the rest of the world has not studied 100 brains since we started this. What weve seen though is very frightening. So some of you might have seen the headline in July in the New York Times. And a recent study we published, that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at 110 were positive for this disease. Of the first 53 college football players we looked at, 48 had this disease. Thats something thats a very big concern to me. And so now, Im very much focused on what can we do to actually treat this disease. We still cant diagnose CTE in living people, we have no treatments that are going to be coming out of the pharmaceutical industry in the next five years. This is a long, long fight. But our Concussion Legacy Foundation is here to not only facilitate this work, and thats the long game, but the short game is, hey, we can prevent this. We can prevent this disease if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much. And frankly, we need to stop hitting children in the head. Turns out, its not a great idea to hit a five year old in the head 500 times each year. And it does actually open up the door to this disease. And so, weve got a lot of work ahead of us. But I have great hope that were on our way to curing this disease. But I hope you understand my story a little more now. And now that weve gotten to know each other a little bit better, this is the time where I ask you, Can I have your brain. Thank you very much. Thank you. "
"So you know when youre doubled over in pain and youre wondering, is it your appendix or maybe you ate something funny. Well, when that happens to me, I call my friend Sasha, Sasha is a doctor, and I say, Should I rush to the nearest emergency room in a panic. Or am I OK to relax and just wait it out. Yes, I am that annoying friend. But in September 2017, friends of mine were suddenly calling me for my professional opinion. And no, Im not a doctor, but they were asking me questions of life and death. So what was going on in September of 2017. Well, North Korea was suddenly and scarily all over the news. Kim Jong un had tested missiles potentially capable of hitting major US cities, and President Trump had responded with tweets of fire and fury. And there was real concern that tensions would escalate to a potential war or even nuclear weapons use. So what my friends were calling and asking was. Should they panic or were the OK to relax. But really, they were asking me a fundamental question, Am I safe. While I was reassuring them that, no, they didnt need to worry just yet, the irony of their question dawned on me. What they hadnt really thought about is that weve all been living under a much larger cloud for decades, potentially a mushroom cloud, without giving it much thought. Now its not surprising that friends of mine and many others like them dont know much about nuclear weapons and dont think about them. After all, the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia, tension abated, we started dismantling nuclear weapons, and they started to become a relic of the past. Generations didnt have to grow up with the specter of nuclear war hanging over their heads. And there other reasons people dont like to think about nuclear weapons. Its scary, overwhelming. I get it. Sometimes I wish I could have chosen a cheerier field to study. Perhaps tax law would have been more uplifting. But in addition to that, people have so many other things to think about in their busy lives, and theyd much prefer to think about something over which they feel they have some semblance of control, and they assume that other people, smarter than they on this topic, are working away to keep us all safe. And then, there are other reasons people dont talk about this, and one is because we, as nuclear experts, use a whole lot of convoluted jargon and terminology to talk about these issues. CVID, ICBM, JCPOA. Its really inaccessible for a lot of people. And, in reality, it actually sometimes I think makes us numb to what were really talking about here. And what we are really talking about here is the fact that, while weve made dramatic reductions in the number of nuclear weapons since the Cold War, right now, there are almost 15,000 in the world today. 15,000. The United States and Russia have over 90 percent of these nuclear weapons. If youre wondering, these are the countries that have the rest. But they have far fewer, ranging in the sort of 300 ish range and below. Adding to this situation is the fact that we have new technologies that potentially bring us new challenges. Could you imagine, one day, countries like ours and others potentially ceding decisions about a nuclear strike to a robot, based on algorithms. And what data do they use to inform those algorithms. This is pretty terrifying. So adding to this are terrorism potential, cyberattacks, miscalculation, misunderstanding. The list of nuclear nightmares tends to grow longer by the day. And there are a number of former officials, as well as experts, who worry that right now, were in greater danger than we were in various points in the Cold War. So this is scary. What can we do. Well, thankfully, we dont have to rely on the advice from the 1950s. We can take some control, and the way we do that is by starting to ask some fundamental questions about the status quo and whether we are happy with the way it is. We need to begin asking questions of ourselves and of our elected officials, and Id like to share three with you today. The first one is, How much nuclear risk are you willing to take or tolerate. Right now, nuclear policy depends on deterrence theory. Developed in the 1950s, the idea is that one countrys nuclear weapons prevents another country from using theirs. So you nuke me, I nuke you, and we both lose. So in a way, theres a stalemate. No one uses their weapons, and were all safe. But this theory has real questions. There are experts who challenge this theory and wonder. Does it really work this way in practice. It certainly doesnt allow for mistakes or miscalculations. Now, I dont know about you, but I feel pretty uncomfortable gambling my future survival, yours, and our future generations, on a theory that is questionable and doesnt allow any room for a mistake. It makes me even more uncomfortable to be threatening the evaporation of millions of people on the other side of the Earth. Surely we can do better for ourselves, drawing on our ingenuity to solve complex problems, as we have in the past. After all, this is a man made, human made, I shouldnt say man, because women were involved, a human made problem. We have human solutions that should be possible. So, next question, Who do you think should make nuclear decisions. Right now, in this democracy, in the United States, one person gets to decide whether or not to launch a nuclear strike. They dont have to consult anybody. So thats the president. He or she can decide, within a very limited amount of time, under great pressure, potentially, depending on the scenario, maybe based on a miscalculation or a misunderstanding, they can decide the fate of millions of lives, yours, mine, our communitys. And they can do this and launch a nuclear strike, potentially setting in motion the annihilation of the human race. Wow. This doesnt have to be our reality, though, and in fact, in a number of other countries that have nuclear weapons, its not, including countries that are not democracies. We created this system. We can change it. And theres actually a movement underway to do so. So this leads me to my third question, What do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons, and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf. Well, Congress has a very important role to play in oversight of and interrogating US nuclear weapons policy. They can decide what to fund, what not to fund, and they represent you. Now unfortunately, since the end of the Cold War, weve seen a real decline in the level of understanding, on Capitol Hill, about these issues. While we are starting to see some terrific new champions emerge, the reality is that the general lack of awareness is highly concerning, given that these people need to make critically important decisions. To make matters worse, the political partisanship that currently grips Washington also affects this issue. This wasnt always the case, though. At the end of the Cold War, members from both sides of the aisle had a really good understanding about the nuclear challenges we were facing and worked together on cooperative programs. They recognized that nuclear risk reduction was far too important to allow it to succumb to political partisanship. They created programs such as the Nunn Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which sought to lock down and eliminate vulnerable nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. So we need to return to this era of bipartisanship, mutual problem solving thats based on understanding and awareness about the challenges we face and the real nuclear dangers. And thats where you come in. Public pressure is important. Leaders need a constituent base to act. So create that constituent base, by asking them some simple questions. Ask them, What do you know about nuclear weapons. Do you have a nuclear expert on your staff. Or, if not, do you know somebody you could refer to if you need to make an important decision. Start to find out what they believe and whether it aligns with your own views and values. Ask them, How would you choose to spend US national treasure. On a new nuclear arms race or another national security priority, such as cybersecurity or climate change. Ask them, Are you willing to put aside partisanship to address this existential threat that affects my survival and your constituents survival. Now, people will tell you nuclear policy is far too difficult to understand and complexed and nuanced for the general public to understand, let alone debate. After all, this is national security. There needs to be secrets. Dont let that put you off. We debate all sorts of issues that are critically important to our lives, why should nuclear weapons be any different. We debate health care, education, the environment. Surely congressional oversight, civic participation that are such hallmarks of US democracy, surely they apply here. After all, these are cases of life and death that were talking about. And we wont all agree, but whether or not you believe nuclear weapons keep us safe or that nuclear weapons are a liability, I urge you to put aside partisan, ideological issues and listen to each other. So Ill tell you now what I didnt have the guts to tell my friends at the time. No, youre not safe, not just because of North Korea. But there is something you can do about it. Demand that your elected representatives can give you answers to your questions, and answers that you can live with and that billions of others can live with too. And if they cant, stay on them until they can. And if that doesnt work, find others, who are able to represent your views. Because by doing so, we can begin to change the answer to the question Am I safe. "
"I had a fire nine days ago. My archive, 175 films, my 16 millimeter negative, all my books, my dads books, my photographs. Id collected, I was a collector, major, big time. Its gone. I just looked at it, and I didnt know what to do. I mean, this was, was I my things. I always live in the present, I love the present. I cherish the future. And I was taught some strange thing as a kid, like, youve got to make something good out of something bad. Youve got to make something good out of something bad. This was bad. Man, I was, I cough. I was sick. Thats my camera lens. The first one, the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago. Thats my feature film. King, Murray won Cannes Film Festival 1970, the only print I had. Thats my papers. That was in minutes, 20 minutes. Epiphany hit me. Something hit me. Youve got to make something good out of something bad, I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister. By the way, thats Sputnik. I ran it last year. Sputnik was downtown, the negative. It wasnt touched. These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film, which opens in New York in two weeks downtown. I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, Come dig. Thats me at my desk. That was a desk took 40 some years to build. You know, all the stuff. Thats my daughter, Jean. She came. Shes a nurse in San Francisco. Dig it up, I said. Pieces. I want pieces. Bits and pieces. I came up with this idea, a life of bits and pieces, which Im just starting to work on, my next project. Thats my sister. She took care of pictures, because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot. And those are some of the pictures that, something was good about the burnt pictures. I didnt know. I looked at that, I said, Wow, is that better than the, Thats my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television. Its the only copy I had. Pieces of it. Idea about women. So I started to say, Hey, man, you are too much. You could cry about this. I really didnt. I just instead said, Im going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people whove already given me so much solace, and just say to TEDsters. Im proud of me. That I take something bad, I turn it, and Im going to make something good out of this, all these pieces. Thats Arthur Leipzigs original photograph I loved. I was a big record collector, the records didnt make it. Boy, I tell you, film burns. Film burns. I mean, this was 16 millimeter safety film. The negatives are gone. Thats my fathers letter to me, telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was 20. Thats my daughter and me. Shes still there. Shes there this morning, actually. Thats my house. My familys living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley. Thats my wife, Heidi, who didnt take it as well as I did. My children, Davey and Henry. My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago. So, my message to you folks, from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED. I came to live it, and I am living it. Thats my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon, just 35 miles from here. Thank you everybody. "
"I want to share some personal friends and stories with you that Ive actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world. Twenty four years ago, I had, a sophomore in college, I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved. And I ended up in student health, and they ran some labwork and came back right away, and said, Kidney problems. And before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me. And Im sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound, and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once, and Im like, Uh oh, this is bad news. And their diagnosis was this. They said, You have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually, you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away, and youll never be eligible for a kidney transplant, and youre not likely to live more than two or three years. Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis, it just sucked me in immediately, as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me, until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room, who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases, and said, Eric, these people who get this are normally in their 70s and 80s. They dont know anything about you. Wake up. Take control of your health and get on with your life. And I did. Now, these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people. In fact, these professionals were miracle workers, but theyre working in a flawed, expensive system thats set up the wrong way. Its dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need. Its dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. Its dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails, and so something either works or you die. And its dependent on passive patients who just take it and dont ask any questions. Now the problem with this model is that its unsustainable globally. Its unaffordable globally. We need to invent what I call a personal health system. So what does this personal health system look like, and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail. Now, Im going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine, Libby, somebody Ive become quite attached to over the last six months. This is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby. This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have. Now, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today, and youll notice, on the edge of this image, theres some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me. So were going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libbys doing. This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here. Dont you in the front row worry or anything. Im going to use a device from a company called Mobisante. This is a portable ultrasound. It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet. Mobisante is up in Redmond, Washington, and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself. Theyre not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this. This is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear. All right, I gotta gel up. Now the people in the front row are very nervous. And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk, whos another friend of mine. Hes up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon. So let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay. And actually, can you see Libby. Hi there, Eric. You look busy. How are you. Im good. Im just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. Its wonderful. So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get. And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there. Okay. Well lets scan around a little bit here, give me a lay of the land. All right. Okay. Turn it a little bit inside, a little bit toward the middle for me. Okay, thats good. How about up a little bit. Okay, freeze that image. Thats a good one for me. All right. Now last week, when I did this, you had me measure that spot to the right. Should I do that again. Yeah, lets do that. All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring, but Ive got it, I think, and Ill save that image and send it to you. So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means. Its not something I was very happy about. Many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney. Most of the time it doesnt create any kind of mischief, but it does warrant looking at, so Im happy weve got an opportunity to look at it today, make sure that its not growing, its not creating any problems. Based on the other images we have, Im really happy how it looks today. All right. Well, I guess well double check it when I come in. Ive got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks, and Im going to let you do that in the clinic, because I dont think I can do that one on myself. Good choice. All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk. All right. So what youre sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies, of mobile, social and analytic technologies. These are the foundations of whats going to make personal health possible. Now theres really three pillars of this personal health I want to talk to you about now, and its care anywhere, care networking and care customization. And you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. So lets start with care anywhere. Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking. We have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care, because these places are often the wrong tool, and the most expensive tool, for the job. And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients, especially in an era of superbugs and hospital acquired infections. And many countries are going to go brickless from the start because theyre never going to be able to afford the mega medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built. Now I personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age. This was me in third grade. I broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery, worried that they were going to actually lose the arm. Recovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores. Those bedsores become infected, and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to, and now my whole body breaks out, and now all of those become infected. The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became, and the more expensive it became, and this happens to millions of people around the world every year. The future of personal health that Im talking about says care must occur at home as the default model, not in a hospital or clinic. You have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job. Now the smartphones that were already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them, and a whole array of others, today, and as sensing is built into these, well be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like weve never had before. Many of us will have implantables that will actually look real time at whats going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now. Now the software is also getting smarter, right. Think about a coach, an agent online, thats going to help me do safe self care. That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing, and the device will say, Up, down, left, right, ah, Eric, thats the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor. Now, if weve got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere, it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff, and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about, care networking. We have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care. Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best, and it is deadly at worst. Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members. I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school, when were under treatment for the kidney, and suddenly, theyre like, Oh, we think you have a heart problem. And I have these palpitations that are showing up. They put me through five weeks of tests, very expensive, very scary, before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper, my meds list that Ive been carrying to every single appointment, and says, Oh my gosh. Three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me. I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem. I had a care coordination problem. And this happens to millions of people every year. I want to use technology that were all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport. Now this is the most frightening thing to me. Out of all the care Ive had in hospitals and clinics around the world, the first time Ive ever had a true team based care experience was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months for me to go get this. And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy. Theres a couple of the folks here. Youll recognize Dr. Batiuk. We just talked to him. Heres Jenny, one of the nurses, Allison, who helped manage the transplant list, and a dozen other people who arent pictured, a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist, even a financial counselor, Lisa, who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles. I wept the day I graduated. I should have been happy, because I was so well that I could go back to my normal doctors, but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. And heres the most important part. The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley. Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics. Thats the only way that the model works. My team is actually working in China on one of these self care models for a project we called Age Friendly Cities. Were trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers, as well as have an exchange network online, where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom, if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals, and we exchange all of that online. The most important point I want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over romanticized doctor patient one on one is a relic of the past. The future of health care is smart teams, and youd better be on that team for yourself. Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about is care customization, because if youve got care anywhere and youve got care networking, those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system, but theres still too much guesswork. Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948 to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis, and those are important things, dont get me wrong. These population studies that weve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives, but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages, not unique individuals, because at the end of the day, the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied. Thats whats leading to the guesswork. The technologies that are coming, high performance computing, analytics, big data that everyones talking about, will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients. And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar in software, not my body in suffering. Now, Ive had two examples I want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey. The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity. Its like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live. I was optimizing my life for quality of life, and quality of life for me means time in snow. So on my chart, I forced them to put, Patient goal, low doses of drugs over longer periods of time, side effects friendly to skiing. And I think thats why I achieved longevity. I think that time in snow therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that I had. Now the second example of customization, and by the way, you cant customize care if you dont know your own goals, so health care cant know those until you know your own health care goals. But the second example I want to give you is, I happened to be an early guinea pig, and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced. Now it took about two weeks of processing on Intels highest end servers to make this happen, and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data. And at the end of all of that, they said, Yes, those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong, and we have a better path forward. The future that Intels working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours, and make this kind of tool available, not just in the mainframes of tier one research hospitals around the world, but in the mainstream, every patient, every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing. And I tell you, this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime. So these three pillars of personal health, care anywhere, care networking, care customization, are happening in pieces now, but this vision will completely fail if we dont step up as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles. Its what my friend Verna said. Wake up and take control of your health. Because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways. And its in that spirit that I want to introduce you to one last friend, very quickly. Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that I was never supposed to have. So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. For me, it was really easy. I only had one night in the hospital. The surgery was done laparoscopically, so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen, and I had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything Id done before without any changes. Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again. So thank you feel likes a really trite word, but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. This TED stage and all of the TED stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies, and Ive done that here today, and Ive seen amazing things coming from TED speakers, I mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming. But until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us, and even when they are, its up to us to care for, and even save, one another. I hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much. "
"She wrote, When I become famous, I will tell everyone that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson. Heroes rarely look like me. In fact, Im what garbage looks like. No, not the most appealing way to open a talk or start a conversation, and perhaps you have some questions going through your head about that. Why would this man say such a thing about himself. What does he mean. How can someone view him as a hero when he sees himself as garbage. I believe we learn more from questions than we do from answers. Because when were questioning something, were invested in taking in some sort of new information, or grappling with some sort of ignorance that makes us feel uncomfortable. And thats why Im here, to push us to question, even when it makes us uncomfortable. My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago, the southernmost island in the Caribbean. Trinidad is also home to the only acoustic instrument invented in the 20th century, the steel pan. Deriving from the African drums and evolving from the genius of one of the ghettos in Trinidad, a city called Laventille, and the disregard of the American military ... Well, I should tell you, America, during WWII, had military bases set up in Trinidad, and when the war ended, they left the island littered with empty oil drums, their trash. So people from Laventille repurposed the old drums left behind into the full chromatic scale, the steel pan. Playing music now from Beethoven to Bob Marley to 50 Cent, those people literally made music out of garbage. Twelve days before my 20th birthday, I was arrested for my role in a violent robbery attempt in lower Manhattan. While people were sitting in a coffee shop, four people were shot. Two were killed. Five of us were arrested. We were all the products of Trinidad and Tobago. We were the bad immigrants, or the anchor babies that Trump and millions of Americans easily malign. I was discarded, like waste material, and justifiably so to many. I eventually served 10 years, two months and seven days of a prison sentence. I was sentenced to a decade of punishment in a correctional institution. I was sentenced to irrelevance, the opposite of humanity. Interestingly, it was during those years in prison that a series of letters redeemed me, helped me move beyond the darkness and the guilt associated with the worst moment of my young life. It gave me a sense that I was useful. She was 13 years old. She had wrote that she saw me as a hero. I remember reading that, and I remember crying when I read those words. She was one of over 50 students and 150 letters that I wrote during a mentoring correspondence program that I co designed with a friend who was a teacher at a middle school in Brooklyn, my hometown. We called it the Young Scholars Program. Every time those young people shared their stories with me, their struggles, every time they drew a picture of their favorite cartoon character and sent it to me, every time they said they depended on my letters or my words of advice, it boosted my sense of worthiness. It gave me a sense of what I could contribute to this planet. It transformed my life. Because of those letters and what they shared with me, their stories of teen life, they gave me the permission, they gave me the courage to admit to myself that there were reasons, not excuses, but that there were reasons for that fateful day in October of 1999, that the trauma associated with living in a community where guns are easier to get than sneakers, that the trauma associated with being raped at gunpoint at the age of 14, that those are reasons for me why making that decision, that fatal decision, was not an unlikely proposition. Because those letters mattered so much to me, because writing and receiving and having that communication with those folks so hugely impacted my life, I decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine who were also inside with me. My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks, all in prison for violent crimes also, shared their words of wisdom with the young people as well, and received the sense of relevancy in return. We are now published writers and youth program innovators and trauma experts and gun violence prevention advocates, and TED talkers and, and good daddies. Thats what I call a positive return of investment. Above all else, what building that program taught me was that when we sow, when we invest in the humanity of people no matter where theyre at, we can reap amazing rewards. In this latest era of criminal justice reform, I often question and wonder why, why is it that so many believe that only those who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses merit empathy and recognized humanity. Criminal justice reform is human justice. Am I not human. When we invest in resources that amplify the relevancy of people in communities like Laventille or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you, we can literally create the communities that we want. We can do better. We can do better than investing solely in law enforcement as a resource, because they dont give us a sense of relevancy that is at the core of why so many of us do so many harmful things in the pursuit of mattering. See, gun violence is just a visible display of a lot of underlying traumas. When we invest in the redemptive value of relevancy, we can render a return of both personal responsibility and healing. Thats the people work I care about, because people work. Family, Im asking you to do the hard work, the difficult work, the churning work of bestowing undeserved kindness upon those who we can relegate as garbage, who we can disregard and discard easily. Im asking myself. Over the past two months, Ive lost two friends to gun violence, both innocent bystanders. One was caught in a drive by while walking home. The other was sitting in a cafe while eating breakfast, while on vacation in Miami. Im asking myself to see the redemptive value of relevancy in the people that murdered them, because of the hard work of seeing the value in me. Im pushing us to challenge our own capacity to fully experience our humanity, by understanding the full biography of people who we can easily choose not to see, because heroes are waiting to be recognized, and music is waiting to be made. Thank you. "
"A few days after my husband Paul was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, we were lying in our bed at home, and Paul said, Its going to be OK. And I remember answering back, Yes. We just dont know what OK means yet. Paul and I had met as first year medical students at Yale. He was smart and kind and super funny. He used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car, and hed say, Its for emergencies only. I fell in love with Paul as I watched the care he took with his patients. He stayed late talking with them, seeking to understand the experience of illness and not just its technicalities. He later told me he fell in love with me when he saw me cry over an EKG of a heart that had ceased beating. We didnt know it yet, but even in the heady days of young love, we were learning how to approach suffering together. We got married and became doctors. I was working as an internist and Paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight. He developed excruciating back pain and a cough that wouldnt go away. And when he was admitted to the hospital, a CT scan revealed tumors in Pauls lungs and in his bones. We had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses, now it was our turn. We lived with Pauls illness for 22 months. He wrote a memoir about facing mortality. I gave birth to our daughter Cady, and we loved her and each other. We learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions. The day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life. When he turned to me at the end and said, Im ready, I knew that wasnt just a brave decision. It was the right one. Paul didnt want a ventilator and CPR. In that moment, the most important thing to Paul was to hold our baby daughter. Nine hours later, Paul died. Ive always thought of myself as a caregiver, most physicians do, and taking care of Paul deepened what that meant. Watching him reshape his identity during his illness, learning to witness and accept his pain, talking together through his choices, those experiences taught me that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before, or pretending that the hard stuff isnt hard. It is so hard. Its painful, messy stuff. But its the stuff. And I learned that when we approach it together, we get to decide what success looks like. One of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was, I want you to get remarried. And I was like, whoa, I guess we get to say anything out loud. It was so shocking and heartbreaking ... and generous, and really comforting because it was so starkly honest, and that honesty turned out to be exactly what we needed. Early in Pauls illness, we agreed we would just keep saying things out loud. Tasks like making a will, or completing our advance directives, tasks that I had always avoided, were not as daunting as they once seemed. I realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love, like a wedding vow. A pact to take care of someone, codifying the promise that til death do us part, I will be there. If needed, I will speak for you. I will honor your wishes. That paperwork became a tangible part of our love story. As physicians, Paul and I were in a good position to understand and even accept his diagnosis. We werent angry about it, luckily, because wed seen so many patients in devastating situations, and we knew that death is a part of life. But its one thing to know that, it was a very different experience to actually live with the sadness and uncertainty of a serious illness. Huge strides are being made against lung cancer, but we knew that Paul likely had months to a few years left to live. During that time, Paul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient. He talked about feeling like he was suddenly at a crossroads, and how he would have thought hed be able to see the path, that because he treated so many patients, maybe he could follow in their footsteps. But he was totally disoriented. Rather than a path, Paul wrote, I saw instead only a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert. As if a sandstorm had erased all familiarity. I had to face my mortality and try to understand what made my life worth living, and I needed my oncologists help to do so. The clinicians taking care of Paul gave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care. We have a tough job. Were responsible for helping patients have clarity around their prognoses and their treatment options, and thats never easy, but its especially tough when youre dealing with potentially terminal illnesses like cancer. Some people dont want to know how long they have left, others do. Either way, we never have those answers. Sometimes we substitute hope by emphasizing the best case scenario. In a survey of physicians, 55 percent said they painted a rosier picture than their honest opinion when describing a patients prognosis. Its an instinct born out of kindness. But researchers have found that when people better understand the possible outcomes of an illness, they have less anxiety, greater ability to plan and less trauma for their families. Families can struggle with those conversations, but for us, we also found that information immensely helpful with big decisions. Most notably, whether to have a baby. Months to a few years meant Paul was not likely to see her grow up. But he had a good chance of being there for her birth and for the beginning of her life. I remember asking Paul if he thought having to say goodbye to a child would make dying even more painful. And his answer astounded me. He said, Wouldnt it be great if it did. And we did it. Not in order to spite cancer, but because we were learning that living fully means accepting suffering. Pauls oncologist tailored his chemo so he could continue working as a neurosurgeon, which initially we thought was totally impossible. When the cancer advanced and Paul shifted from surgery to writing, his palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication so he could be more focused. They asked Paul about his priorities and his worries. They asked him what trade offs he was willing to make. Those conversations are the best way to ensure that your health care matches your values. Paul joked that its not like that birds and bees talk you have with your parents, where you all get it over with as quickly as possible, and then pretend it never happened. You revisit the conversation as things change. You keep saying things out loud. Im forever grateful because Pauls clinicians felt that their job wasnt to try to give us answers they didnt have, or only to try to fix things for us, but to counsel Paul through painful choices ... when his body was failing but his will to live wasnt. Later, after Paul died, I received a dozen bouquets of flowers, but I sent just one ... to Pauls oncologist, because she supported his goals and she helped him weigh his choices. She knew that living means more than just staying alive. A few weeks ago, a patient came into my clinic. A woman dealing with a serious chronic disease. And while we were talking about her life and her health care, she said, I love my palliative care team. They taught me that its OK to say no. Yeah, I thought, of course it is. But many patients dont feel that. Compassion and Choices did a study where they asked people about their health care preferences. And a lot of people started their answers with the words Well, if I had a choice ... If I had a choice. And when I read that if, I understood better why one in four people receives excessive or unwanted medical treatment, or watches a family member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment. Its not because doctors dont get it. We do. We understand the real psychological consequences on patients and their families. The things is, we deal with them, too. Half of critical care nurses and a quarter of ICU doctors have considered quitting their jobs because of distress over feeling that for some of their patients, theyve provided care that didnt fit with the persons values. But doctors cant make sure your wishes are respected until they know what they are. Would you want to be on life support if it offered any chance of longer life. Are you most worried about the quality of that time, rather than quantity. Both of those choices are thoughtful and brave, but for all of us, its our choice. Thats true at the end of life and for medical care throughout our lives. If youre pregnant, do you want genetic screening. Is a knee replacement right or not. Do you want to do dialysis in a clinic or at home. The answer is, it depends. What medical care will help you live the way you want to. I hope you remember that question the next time you face a decision in your health care. Remember that you always have a choice, and it is OK to say no to a treatment thats not right for you. Theres a poem by W.S. Merwin, its just two sentences long, that captures how I feel now. Your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle. Everything I do is stitched with its color. For me that poem evokes my love for Paul, and a new fortitude that came from loving and losing him. When Paul said, Its going to be OK, that didnt mean that we could cure his illness. Instead, we learned to accept both joy and sadness at the same time, to uncover beauty and purpose both despite and because we are all born and we all die. And for all the sadness and sleepless nights, it turns out there is joy. I leave flowers on Pauls grave and watch our two year old run around on the grass. I build bonfires on the beach and watch the sunset with our friends. Exercise and mindfulness meditation have helped a lot. And someday, I hope I do get remarried. Most importantly, I get to watch our daughter grow. Ive thought a lot about what Im going to say to her when shes older. Cady, engaging in the full range of experience, living and dying, love and loss, is what we get to do. Being human doesnt happen despite suffering. It happens within it. When we approach suffering together, when we choose not to hide from it, our lives dont diminish, they expand. Ive learned that cancer isnt always a battle. Or if it is, maybe its a fight for something different than we thought. Our job isnt to fight fate, but to help each other through. Not as soldiers but as shepherds. Thats how we make it OK, even when its not. By saying it out loud, by helping each other through ... and a gorilla suit never hurts, either. Thank you. "
"Many of us will experience some kind of trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape with no long term effects. But for millions of us, those experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts that interfere with everyday life. This phenomenon, called post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, isnt a personal failing, rather, its a treatable malfunction of certain biological mechanisms that allow us to cope with dangerous experiences. To understand PTSD, we first need to understand how the brain processes a wide range of ordeals, including the death of a loved one, domestic violence, injury or illness, abuse, rape, war, car accidents, and natural disasters. These events can bring on feelings of danger and helplessness, which activate the brains alarm system, known as the fight flight freeze response. When this alarm sounds, the hypothalamic, pituitary, and adrenal systems, known as the HPA axis, work together to send signals to the parasympathetic nervous system. Thats the network that communicates with adrenal glands and internal organs to help regulate functions like heart rate, digestion, and respiration. These signals start a chemical cascade that floods the body with several different stress hormones, causing physiological changes that prepare the body to defend itself. Our heart rate speeds up, breathing quickens, and muscles tense. Even after a crisis is over, escalated levels of stress hormones may last for days, contributing to jittery feelings, nightmares, and other symptoms. For most people, these experiences disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize. But a small percentage of those who experience trauma have persistent problems, sometimes vanishing temporarily only to resurface months later. We dont completely understand whats happening in the brain, but one theory is that the stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating the fight flight freeze response while reducing overall brain functioning, leading to a number of negative symptoms. These symptoms often fall into four categories, intrusive thoughts, like dreams and flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma, negative thoughts and feelings, like fear, anger, and guilt, and reactive symptoms like irritability and difficulty sleeping. Not everyone has all these symptoms, or experiences them to the same extent and intensity. When problems last more than a month, PTSD is often diagnosed. Genetics, on going overwhelming stress, and many risk factors like preexisting mental illnesses or lack of emotional support, likely play a role in determining who will experience PTSD. But the underlying cause is still a medical mystery. A major challenge of coping with PTSD is sensitivity to triggers, physical and emotional stimuli that the brain associates with the original trauma. These can be everyday sensations that arent inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical and emotional reactions. For example, the smell of a campfire could evoke the memory of being trapped in a burning house. For someone with PTSD, that memory activates the same neurochemical cascade as the original event. That then stirs up the same feelings of panic and helplessness as if theyre experiencing the trauma all over again. Trying to avoid these triggers, which are sometimes unpredictable, can lead to isolation. That can leave people feeling invalidated, ignored, or misunderstood, like a pause button has been pushed on their lives while the rest of the world continues around them. But, there are options. If you think you might be suffering from PTSD, the first step is an evaluation with a mental health professional who can direct you towards the many resources available. Psychotherapy can be very effective for PTSD, helping patients better understand their triggers. And certain medications can make symptoms more manageable, as can self care practices, like mindfulness and regular exercise. What if you notice signs of PTSD in a friend or family member. Social support, acceptance, and empathy are key to helping and recovery. Let them know you believe their account of what theyre experiencing, and that you dont blame them for their reactions. If theyre open to it, encourage them to seek evaluation and treatment. PTSD has been called the hidden wound because it comes without outward physical signs. But even if its an invisible disorder, it doesnt have to be a silent one."
"I was told to come here and tell you all stories, but what Id like to do is instead tell you why Im suspicious of stories, why stories make me nervous. In fact, the more inspired a story makes me feel, very often, the more nervous I get. So the best stories are often the trickiest ones. The good and bad things about stories is that they are a kind of filter. They take a lot of information, and they leave some of it out, and they keep some of it in. But the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in. Youre always left with the same few simple stories. There is the old saying that just about every story can be summed up as a stranger came to town. There is a book by Christopher Booker, where he claims there are really just seven types of stories. There is monster, rags to riches, quest, voyage and return, comedy, tragedy, rebirth. You dont have to agree with that list exactly, but the point is this, if you think in terms of stories, youre telling yourself the same things over and over again. There was a study done, we asked some people, people were asked to describe their lives. When asked to describe their lives, what is interesting is how few people said mess. Its probably the best answer, I dont mean that in a bad way. Mess can be liberating, mess can be empowering, mess can be a way of drawing upon multiple strengths. But what people wanted to say was, My life is a journey. 51 percent wanted to turn his or her life into a story. 11 percent said, My life is a battle. Again, that is a kind of story. 8 percent said, My life is a novel. 5 percent said, My life is a play. I dont think anyone said, My life is a reality TV show. But again, were imposing order on the mess we observe, and its taking the same patterns, and the thing is when something is in the form of a story, often, we remember it when we shouldnt. So how many of you know the story about George Washington and the cherry tree. Its not obvious that is exactly what happened. The story of Paul Revere, its not obvious that that is exactly the way it happened. So again, we should be suspicious of stories. Were biologically programmed to respond to them. They contain a lot of information. They have social power. They connect us to other people. So they are like a candy that were fed when we consume political information, when we read novels. When we read non fiction books, were really being fed stories. Non fiction is, in a sense, the new fiction. The book may happen to say true things, but again, everythings taking the same form of these stories. So what are the problems of relying too heavily on stories. You view your life like this instead of the mess that it is or it ought to be. But more specifically, I think of a few major problems when we think too much in terms of narrative. First, narratives tend to be too simple, for the point of a narrative is to strip it away, not just into 18 minutes, but most narratives you can present in a sentence or two. When you strip away detail, you tend to tell stories in terms of good versus evil, whether its a story about your own life or a story about politics. I know some things actually are good versus evil, we all know this, right. But I think, as a general rule, were too inclined to tell the good versus evil story. As a simple rule of thumb, just imagine that every time youre telling a good versus evil story, youre basically lowering your IQ by ten points or more. If you just adopt that as a kind of inner mental habit, its, in my view, one way to get a lot smarter pretty quickly. You dont have to read any books. Just imagine yourself pressing a button every time you tell the good versus evil story, and by pressing that button, youre lowering your IQ by ten points or more. Another set of stories that are popular, if you know Oliver Stones movies, or Michael Moores movies, you cant make a movie and say, It was all a big accident. No, it has to be a conspiracy, people plotting together, because in a story, a story is about intention. A story is not about spontaneous order or complex human institutions which are the product of human action, but not of human design. No, a story is about evil people plotting together. So when you hear stories about plots, or even stories about good people plotting things together, just like when youre watching movies, this, again, is reason to be suspicious. As a good rule of thumb, if youre asking, When I hear a story, when should I be especially suspicious. If you hear a story and you think, Wow, that would make a great movie. Thats when the uh oh reaction should pop in a bit more, and you should start thinking in terms of how the whole thing is maybe a bit of a mess. Another common story or storyline is the claim that we have to get tough. Youll hear this in so many contexts. We have to get tough with the banks. We had to get tough with the labor unions. We need to get tough with some other country, some foreign dictator, someone were negotiating with. Again, the point is not against getting tough. Sometimes we should get tough. That we got tough with the Nazis was a good thing. But this is again a story we fall back upon all too readily, all too quickly. When we dont really know why something happened, we blame someone, and we say, We need to get tough with them. As if it had never occurred to your predecessor, this idea of getting tough. I view it usually as a kind of mental laziness. Its a simple story you tell, We need to get tough, we needed to get tough, we will have to get tough. Usually, that is a kind of warning signal. Another kind of problem with stories is you can only fit so many stories into your mind at once, or in the course of a day, or even over the course of a lifetime. So your stories are serving too many purposes. For instance, just to get out of bed in the morning, you tell yourself the story that your job is really important, what youre doing is really important and maybe it is, but I tell myself that story even when its not. And you know what. That story works. It gets me out of bed. Its a kind of self deception, but the problem comes when I need to change that story. The whole point of the story is that I grab onto it and I hold it, and it gets me out of bed. So when Im really doing something that is actually just a waste of time, in my mess of a life, Im too tied into my story that got me out of bed, and ideally, I ought to have some very complex story map in my mind, you know, with combinatorials and a matrix of computation, and the like, but that is not how stories work. Stories in order to work have to be simple, easily grasped, easily told to others, easily remembered. So stories will serve dual and conflicting purposes, and very often they will lead us astray. I used to think I was within the camp of economists, I was one of the good guys, and I was allied with other good guys, and we were fighting the ideas of the bad guys. I used to think that. And probably, I was wrong. Maybe sometimes, Im one of the good guys, but on some issues, I finally realized, Hey, I wasnt one of the good guys. Im not sure I was the bad guy in the sense of having evil intent, but it was very hard for me to get away with that story. One interesting thing about cognitive biases is they are the subject of so many books these days. Theres the Nudge book, the Sway book, the Blink book, like the one title book, all about the ways in which we screw up. And there are so many ways, but what I find interesting is that none of these books identify what, to me, is the single, central, most important way we screw up, and that is that we tell ourselves too many stories, or we are too easily seduced by stories. Why dont these books tell us that. Its because the books themselves are all about stories. The more of these books you read, youre learning about some of your biases, but youre making some of your other biases essentially worse. So the books themselves are part of your cognitive bias. Often, people buy them as a kind of talisman, like, I bought this book. I wont be Predictably Irrational. Its like people want to hear the worst, so psychologically, they can prepare for it or defend against it. Its why there is such a market for pessimism. But to think that by buying the book gets you somewhere, thats maybe the bigger fallacy. Its just like the evidence that shows that the most dangerous people are those who have been taught some financial literacy. Theyre the ones who go out and make the worst mistakes. Its the people who realize they dont know anything at all, that end up doing pretty well. A third problem with stories is that outsiders manipulate us using stories, and we all like to think advertising only works on the other guy, but, of course, thats not how it is, advertising works on all of us. So if youre too attached to stories, what will happen is people selling products come along, and they will bundle their product with a story. Youre like, Hey, a free story. And you end up buying the product, because the product and the story go together. If you think about how capitalism works, there is a bias here. Lets consider two kinds of stories about cars. Story A is, Buy this car, and you will have beautiful, romantic partners and a fascinating life. There are a lot of people who have a financial incentive to promote that story. But, say, the alternative story is, You dont actually need a car as nice as your income would indicate. What you usually do is look at what your peers do and copy them. That is a good heuristic for lots of problems, but when it comes to cars, just buy a Toyota. Maybe Toyota has an incentive there, but even Toyota is making more money off the luxury cars, and less money off the cheaper cars. So if you think which set of stories you end up hearing, you end up hearing the glamor stories, the seductive stories, and again Im telling you, dont trust them. There are people using your love of stories to manipulate you. Pull back and say, What are the messages, what are the stories that no one has an incentive to tell. Start telling yourself those, and then see if any of your decisions change. That is one simple way. You can never get out of the pattern of thinking in terms of stories, but you can improve the extent to which you think in stories, and make some better decisions. So if Im thinking about this talk, Im wondering, of course, what is it you take away from this talk. What story do you take away from Tyler Cowen. One story you might be like the story of the quest. Tyler was a man on a quest. Tyler came here, and he told us not to think so much in terms of stories. That would be a story you could tell about this talk. It would fit a pretty well known pattern. You might remember it. You could tell it to other people. This weird guy came, and he said, Dont think in terms of stories. Let me tell you what happened today. And you tell your story. Another possibility is you might tell a story of rebirth. You might say, I used to think too much in terms of stories but then I heard Tyler Cowen and now I think less in terms of stories. That too is a narrative you will remember, you can tell to other people, and again, it may stick. You also could tell a story of deep tragedy. This guy Tyler Cowen came and he told us not to think in terms of stories, but all he could do was tell us stories about how other people think too much in terms of stories. So, today, which is it. Is it like quest, rebirth, tragedy. Or maybe some combination of the three. Im really not sure, and Im not here to tell you to burn your DVD player and throw out your Tolstoy. To think in terms of stories is fundamentally human. There is a Gabriel Garcia Marquez memoir Living to Tell the Tale that we use memory in stories to make sense of what weve done, to give meaning to our lives, to establish connections with other people. None of this will go away, should go away, or can go away. But again, as an economist, Im thinking about life on the margin, the extra decision. Should we think more in terms of stories, or less in terms of stories. When we hear stories, should we be more suspicious. And what kind of stories should we be suspicious of. Again, Im telling you its the stories, very often, that you like the most, that you find the most rewarding, the most inspiring. The stories that dont focus on opportunity cost, or the complex, unintended consequences of human action, because that very often does not make for a good story. So often a story is a story of triumph, a story of struggle, there are opposing forces, which are either evil or ignorant, there is a person on a quest, someone making a voyage, and a stranger coming to town. And those are your categories, but dont let them make you too happy. As an alternative, at the margin, again, no burning of Tolstoy, but just be a little more messy. If I actually had to live those journeys, and quests, and battles, that would be so oppressive to me. Its like, my goodness, cant I just have my life in its messy, ordinary, I hesitate to use the word, glory but that its fun for me. Do I really have to follow some kind of narrative. Cant I just live. So be more comfortable with messy. Be more comfortable with agnostic, and I mean this about the things that make you feel good. Its so easy to pick out a few areas to be agnostic in, and then feel good about it, like, I am agnostic about religion, or politics. Its a kind of portfolio move you make to be more dogmatic elsewhere, right. Sometimes, the most intellectually trustworthy people are the ones who pick one area, and they are totally dogmatic in that, so pig headedly unreasonable, that you think, How can they possibly believe that. But it soaks up their stubbornness, and then, on other things, they can be pretty open minded. So dont fall into the trap of thinking because youre agnostic on some things, that youre being fundamentally reasonable about your self deception, your stories, and your open mindedness. this idea of hovering, of epistemological hovering, and messiness, and incompleteness, and how not everything ties up into a neat bow, and youre really not on a journey here. Youre here for some messy reason or reasons, and maybe you dont know what it is, and maybe I dont know what it is, but anyway, Im happy to be invited, and thank you all for listening. "
"So it all came to life in a dark bar in Madrid. I encountered my colleague from McGill, Michael Meaney. And we were drinking a few beers, and like scientists do, he told me about his work. And he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups after they were born. And I was sitting there and saying, This is where my tax dollars are wasted, on this kind of soft science. And he started telling me that the rats, like humans, lick their pups in very different ways. Some mothers do a lot of that, some mothers do very little, and most are in between. But whats interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults, like, years in human life, long after their mother died. They are completely different animals. The animals that were licked and groomed heavily, the high licking and grooming, are not stressed. They have different sexual behavior. They have a different way of living than those that were not treated as intensively by their mothers. So then I was thinking to myself. Is this magic. How does this work. As geneticists would like you to think, perhaps the mother had the bad mother gene that caused her pups to be stressful, and then it was passed from generation to generation, its all determined by genetics. Or is it possible that something else is going on here. In rats, we can ask this question and answer it. So what we did is a cross fostering experiment. You essentially separate the litter, the babies of this rat, at birth, to two kinds of fostering mothers, not the real mothers, but mothers that will take care of them, high licking mothers and low licking mothers. And you can do the opposite with the low licking pups. And the remarkable answer was, it wasnt important what gene you got from your mother. It was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats. It is the mother that took care of the pups. So how can this work. I am an a epigeneticist. I am interested in how genes are marked by a chemical mark during embryogenesis, during the time were in the womb of our mothers, and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue. Different genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye. And we thought. Is it possible that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring through her behavior. And we spent 10 years, and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events by which the licking and grooming of the mother, the care of the mother, is translated to biochemical signals that go into the nucleus and into the DNA and program it differently. So now the animal can prepare itself for life. Is life going to be harsh. Is there going to be a lot of food. Are there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around, or will I live in an upper class neighborhood where all I have to do is behave well and proper, and that will gain me social acceptance. And now one can think about how important that process can be for our lives. We inherit our DNA from our ancestors. The DNA is old. It evolved during evolution. But it doesnt tell us if you are going to be born in Stockholm, where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter, or in Ecuador, where theres an equal number of hours for day and night all year round. And that has such an enormous effect on our physiology. So what we suggest is, perhaps what happens early in life, those signals that come through the mother, tell the child what kind of social world youre going to be living in. It will be harsh, and youd better be anxious and be stressful, or its going to be an easy world, and you have to be different. Is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light. Is it going to be a world with a lot of food or little food. If theres no food around, youd better develop your brain to binge whenever you see a meal, or store every piece of food that you have as fat. So this is good. Evolution has selected this to allow our fixed, old DNA to function in a dynamic way in new environments. But sometimes things can go wrong, for example, if youre born to a poor family and the signals are, You better binge, you better eat every piece of food youre going to encounter. But now we humans and our brain have evolved, have changed evolution even faster. Now you can buy McDonalds for one dollar. And therefore, the preparation that we had by our mothers is turning out to be maladaptive. The same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine is going to cause obesity, cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease. So this concept that genes could be marked by our experience, and especially the early life experience, can provide us a unifying explanation of both health and disease. But is true only for rats. The problem is, we cannot test this in humans, because ethically, we cannot administer child adversity in a random way. So if a poor child develops a certain property, we dont know whether this is caused by poverty or whether poor people have bad genes. So geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor because their genes make them poor. Epigeneticists will tell you poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment that creates that phenotype, that property. So we moved to look into our cousins, the monkeys. My colleague, Stephen Suomi, has been rearing monkeys in two different ways, randomly separated the monkey from the mother and reared her with a nurse and surrogate motherhood conditions. So these monkeys didnt have a mother, they had a nurse. And other monkeys were reared with their normal, natural mothers. And when they were old, they were completely different animals. The monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol, they were not sexually aggressive. The monkeys that didnt have a mother were aggressive, were stressed and were alcoholics. So we looked at their DNA early after birth, to see. Is it possible that the mother is marking. Is there a signature of the mother in the DNA of the offspring. These are Day 14 monkeys, and what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics. We can now map those chemical marks, which we call methylation marks, on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution. We can map the entire genome. We can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not. And heres a visual presentation of this. What you see is the genes that got more methylated are red. The genes that got less methylated are green. You can see many genes are changing, because not having a mother is not just one thing, it affects the whole way, it sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look when you become an adult. And you can see the two groups of monkeys extremely well separated from each other. How early does this develop. These monkeys already didnt see their mothers, so they had a social experience. Do we sense our social status, even at the moment of birth. So in this experiment, we took placentas of monkeys that had different social status. Whats interesting about social rank is that across all living beings, they will structure themselves by hierarchy. Monkey number one is the boss, monkey number four is the peon. You put four monkeys in a cage, there will always be a boss and always be a peon. And whats interesting is that the monkey number one is much healthier than monkey number four. And if you put them in a cage, monkey number one will not eat as much. Monkey number four will eat . And what you see here in this methylation mapping, a dramatic separation at birth of the animals that had a high social status versus the animals that did not have a high status. So we are born already knowing the social information, and that social information is not bad or good, it just prepares us for life, because we have to program our biology differently if we are in the high or the low social status. But how can you study this in humans. We cant do experiments, we cant administer adversity to humans. But God does experiments with humans, and its called natural disasters. One of the hardest natural disasters in Canadian history happened in my province of Quebec. Its the ice storm of 1998. We lost our entire electrical grid because of an ice storm when the temperatures were, in the dead of winter in Quebec, minus 20 to minus 30. And there were pregnant mothers during that time. And my colleague Suzanne King followed the children of these mothers for 15 years. And what happened was, that as the stress increased, and here we had objective measures of stress. How long were you without power. Where did you spend your time. Was it in your mother in laws apartment or in some posh country home. So all of these added up to a social stress scale, and you can ask the question. How did the children look. And it appears that as stress increases, the children develop more autism, they develop more metabolic diseases and they develop more autoimmune diseases. We would map the methylation state, and again, you see the green genes becoming red as stress increases, the red genes becoming green as stress increases, an entire rearrangement of the genome in response to stress. So if we can program genes, if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes, that they could be programmed, can we deprogram them. Because epigenetic causes can cause diseases like cancer, metabolic disease and mental health diseases. Lets talk about cocaine addiction. Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation that can lead to death and to loss of human life. We asked the question. Can we reprogram the addicted brain to make that animal not addicted anymore. We used a cocaine addiction model that recapitulates what happens in humans. In humans, youre in high school, some friends suggest you use some cocaine, you take cocaine, nothing happens. Months pass by, something reminds you of what happened the first time, a pusher pushes cocaine, and you become addicted and your life has changed. In rats, we do the same thing. My colleague, Gal Yadid, he trains the animals to get used to cocaine, then for one month, no cocaine. Then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue, the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine. And they go crazy. They will press the lever to get cocaine until they die. We first determined that the difference between these animals is that during that time when nothing happens, theres no cocaine around, their epigenome is rearranged. Their genes are remarked in a different way, and when the cue comes, their genome is ready to develop this addictive phenotype. So we treated these animals with drugs that either increase DNA methylation, which was the epigenetic marker to look at, or decrease epigenetic markings. And we found that if we increased methylation, these animals go even crazier. They become more craving for cocaine. But if we reduce the DNA methylation, the animals are not addicted anymore. We have reprogrammed them. And a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug and any other drug is that with epigenetic drugs, we essentially remove the signs of experience, and once theyre gone, they will not come back unless you have the same experience. The animal now is reprogrammed. So when we visited the animals 30 days, 60 days later, which is in human terms many years of life, they were still not addicted, by a single epigenetic treatment. So what did we learn about DNA. DNA is not just a sequence of letters, its not just a script. DNA is a dynamic movie. Our experiences are being written into this movie, which is interactive. Youre, like, watching a movie of your life, with the DNA, with your remote control. You can remove an actor and add an actor. And so you have, in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics, you have control of the way your genes look, and this has a tremendous optimistic message for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases like cancer, mental health, with a new approach, looking at them as maladaptation. And if we can epigenetically intervene, we can reverse the movie by removing an actor and setting up a new narrative. So what I told you today is, our DNA is really combined of two components, two layers of information. One layer of information is old, evolved from millions of years of evolution. It is fixed and very hard to change. The other layer of information is the epigenetic layer, which is open and dynamic and sets up a narrative that is interactive, that allows us to control, to a large extent, our destiny, to help the destiny of our children and to hopefully conquer disease and serious health challenges that have plagued humankind for a long time. So even though we are determined by our genes, we have a degree of freedom that can set up our life to a life of responsibility. Thank you. "
"We invent. My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. And we do that for a couple of reasons. We invent for fun, invention is a lot of fun to do, and we also invent for profit. The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isnt fun, you wouldnt have the time to do it. So we do this fun and profit oriented inventing for most of what we do, but we also have a program where we invent for humanity, where we take some of our best inventors, and we say, Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has., and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems, which is with dramatic, crazy, out of the box solutions. Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work, so thank you. So Im going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where weve got some solutions underway. Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health, a fantastic thing. But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before theyre administered, and thats because they need to be kept cold. Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures. They go bad very quickly if you dont, and if you dont have stable power grid, this doesnt happen, so kids die. Its not just the loss of the vaccine that matters, its the fact that those kids dont get vaccinated. This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried. These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people, but theyre also put on the backs of pickup trucks. Weve got a different solution. Now, one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it. And we thought, well, thats not really good enough. So we made this thing. This lasts six months with no power, absolutely zero power, because it loses less than a half a watt. Now, this is our second generations prototype. The third generation prototype is, right now, in Uganda being tested. Now, the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas. One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar, something youd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in. They have incredible insulation, so lets put some incredible insulation here. The other idea is kind of interesting, which is, you cant reach inside anymore. Because if you open it up and reach inside, youd let the heat in, the game would be over. So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine. It vends out little individual vials. So a simple idea, which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world. Well move on to malaria. Malaria is one of the great public health problems. Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this. Two hundred million people a year. Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies, 27 will die during my talk. And theres no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved. Another comment of Esthers was that we react when theres a tragedy like Haiti, but that tragedy is ongoing. So what can we do about it. Well, there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. You can spray, the problem is there are environmental issues. You can try to treat people and create awareness. Thats great, except the places that have malaria really bad, they dont have health care systems. A vaccine would be a terrific thing, only they dont work yet. People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates. Its a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for. You can distribute bed nets, and bed nets are very effective if you use them. You dont always use them for that. People fish with them. They dont always get to everyone. And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic, but youre never going to make it extinct with bed nets. Now, malaria is an incredibly complicated disease. We could spend hours going over this. Its got this sort of soap opera like lifestyle, they have sex, they burrow into your liver, they tunnel into your blood cells ... its an incredibly complicated disease, but thats actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria. Theres a lot of potential ways in. One of those ways might be better diagnosis. So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices. One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetics glucose meter works. You take a drop of blood, you put it in there and it automatically tells you. Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure, create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it. The other thing is, you know, it would be even better if you didnt have to draw the blood. And if you look through the eye, or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye, in fact, you may be able to do this directly, without drawing any blood at all, or through your nail beds. Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria. We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin. Its produced by the malaria parasite and its a very interesting crystalline substance. Interesting, anyway, if youre a solid state physicist. Theres a lot of cool stuff we can do with it. This is our femtosecond laser lab. So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond. Thats really, really, really short. This is a pulse of light thats only about one wavelength of light long, so its a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously. It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things, in particular, it lets you find hemozoin. So heres an image of red blood cells, and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells. And using both this technique and other optical techniques, we think we can make those diagnostics. We also have another hemozoin oriented therapy for malaria, a way, in acute cases, to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system. Sort of like doing dialysis, but for relieving the parasite load. This is our thousand core supercomputer. Were kind of software guys, and so nearly any problem that you pose, we like to try to solve with some software. One of the problems that you have if youre trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you dont know whats the most effective thing to do. Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier. You spend a certain amount per bed net. Or you could spray. You can give drug administration. Theres all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness. How can you tell. So weve created, using our supercomputer, the worlds best computer model of malaria, which well show you now. We picked Madagascar. We have every road, every village, every, almost, square inch of Madagascar. We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data. Thats very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether youve got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed. So that sets the stage on which you do this. You then have to introduce the mosquitoes, and you have to model that and how they come and go. Ultimately, it gives you this. This is malaria spreading across Madagascar. And this is this latter part of the rainy season. Were going to the dry season now. It nearly goes away in the dry season, because theres no place for the mosquitoes to breed. And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back. By doing these kinds of simulations, we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life, to be able to simulate both the economic trade offs, how many bed nets versus how much spraying., or the social trade offs, what happens if unrest breaks out. We also try to study our foe. This is a high speed camera view of a mosquito. And, in a moment, were going to see a view of the airflow. Here, were trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles were illuminating with a laser. By understanding how mosquitoes fly, we hope to understand how to make them not fly. Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT. This is a real ad. This is one of those things you just cant make up. Once upon a time, this was the primary technique, and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT. The United States did. In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States, but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it. So we thought, Well, weve done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium, the parasite involved. What can we do to the mosquito. Well, lets try to kill it with consumer electronics. Now, that sounds silly, but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use. Your Blu ray player has a very cheap blue laser. Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer thats used to steer a laser beam very accurately, thats what makes those little dots on the page. And, of course, theres signal processing and digital cameras. So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers. Now, in our company, this is what we call the pinky suck moment. What if we could do that. Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment, and lets think of what could happen if we could do that. Well, we could protect very high value targets like clinics. Clinics are full of people that have malaria. Theyre sick, and so theyre less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes. You really want to protect them. Of course, if you do that, you could also protect your backyard. And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are 100 percent organic. Theyre completely natural. Now, it actually gets better than this. You could, if youre really smart, you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it, and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size. And then you could decide, Is this an insect I want to kill, or an insect I dont want to kill. Moores law made computing cheap, so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down. Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes. Theyre the only ones that are dangerous. Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs. Mosquitoes actually live ... their day to day nutrition comes from nectar, from flowers, in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins, but the female needs the blood meal. So, this sounds really crazy, right. Would you like to see it. Audience. Yeah. Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer, and here it is. Now, after thinking about this a little bit we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser. So, Eric Johanson, who built the device, actually, with parts from eBay, and Pablos Holman over here, hes got mosquitoes in the tank. We have the device over here. And were going to show you, instead of the kill laser, which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse, were going to have a green laser pointer thats going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time, otherwise, you cant see it very well. Take it away Eric. What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage. And we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around. And Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around. Now, thats a fairly straightforward image processing routine, and let me show you how it works. Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as theyre flying around, which is kind of fun. Next we can actually light them up with a laser. Now, this is a low powered laser, and we can actually pick up a wing beat frequency. So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around. Thats a mosquito wing beat youre hearing. Finally, lets see what this looks like. There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up. This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see whats happening. Here we have it running at high speed mode. So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this, and were looking very hard at how to make it highly cost effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world. So it wouldnt be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit em. This is very satisfying. This is one of the first ones we did. The energys a little bit high here. Well loop around here in just a second, and youll see another one. Heres another one. Bang. An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time, weve never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair. The wing motor is very resilient. I mean, here were blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down. So, thats what I have. Thanks very much. "
"So Id like you to imagine for a moment that youre a soldier in the heat of battle. Maybe youre a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe youre a Zulu warrior. Regardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant. Your adrenaline is elevated, and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes, reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy. So now, Id like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout. The scouts job is not to attack or defend. The scouts job is to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. And the scout may hope to learn that, say, theres a bridge in a convenient location across a river. But above all, the scout wants to know whats really there, as accurately as possible. And in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential. But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset, a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives. What Im going to argue today is that having good judgment, making accurate predictions, making good decisions, is mostly about which mindset youre in. To illustrate these mindsets in action, Im going to take you back to 19th century France, where this innocuous looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history. It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff. It was torn up in a wastepaper basket, but when they pieced it back together, they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany. So they launched a big investigation, and their suspicions quickly converged on this man, Alfred Dreyfus. He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell. But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army, and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti Semitic. They compared Dreyfuss handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match, even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity, but never mind that. They went and searched Dreyfuss apartment, looking for any signs of espionage. They went through his files, and they didnt find anything. This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it. Next, they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details. They talked to his teachers, they found that he had studied foreign languages in school, which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life. His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory, which was highly suspicious, right. You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things. So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty. Afterwards, they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two. This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus. And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devils Island, which is this barren rock off the coast of South America. So there he went, and there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence. But for the most part, France considered the matter closed. One thing thats really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were intentionally framing him. But historians dont think thats what happened. As far as we can tell, the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong. Which makes you wonder. What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man. Well, this is a case of what scientists call motivated reasoning. Its this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears, shape the way we interpret information. Some information, some ideas, feel like our allies. We want them to win. We want to defend them. And other information or ideas are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. So this is why I call motivated reasoning, soldier mindset. Probably most of you have never persecuted a French Jewish officer for high treason, I assume, but maybe youve followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul, for example, youre highly motivated to find reasons why hes wrong. But if he judges that the other team committed a foul, awesome. Thats a good call, lets not examine it too closely. Or, maybe youve read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy, like capital punishment. And, as researchers have demonstrated, if you support capital punishment and the study shows that its not effective, then youre highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed. But if it shows that capital punishment works, its a good study. And vice versa, if you dont support capital punishment, same thing. Our judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously, by which side we want to win. And this is ubiquitous. This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships, how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical. Whats most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset, is how unconscious it is. We can think were being objective and fair minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man. However, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over. This is Colonel Picquart. Hes another high ranking officer in the French Army, and like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty. Also like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti Semitic. But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect, What if were all wrong about Dreyfus. What happened was, he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued, even after Dreyfus was in prison. And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo, much closer than Dreyfuss handwriting. So he brought these discoveries to his superiors, but to his dismay, they either didnt care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings, like, Well, all youve really shown, Picquart, is that theres another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfuss handwriting, and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left. But Dreyfus is still guilty. Eventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated. But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time, he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army. A lot of people feel like Picquart cant really be the hero of this story because he was an anti Semite and thats bad, which I agree with. But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti Semitic actually makes his actions more admirable, because he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers, but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that. So to me, Picquart is a poster child for what I call scout mindset. Its the drive not to make one idea win or another lose, but just to see whats really there as honestly and accurately as you can, even if its not pretty or convenient or pleasant. This mindset is what Im personally passionate about. And Ive spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset. Why are some people, sometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can. And the answer is emotional. So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism, scout mindset is, too. Its just rooted in different emotions. For example, scouts are curious. Theyre more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle. Theyre more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations. Scouts also have different values. Theyre more likely to say they think its virtuous to test your own beliefs, and theyre less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak. And above all, scouts are grounded, which means their self worth as a person isnt tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic. So they can believe that capital punishment works. If studies come out showing that it doesnt, they can say, Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesnt mean Im bad or stupid. This cluster of traits is what researchers have found, and Ive also found anecdotally, predicts good judgment. And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that theyre primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know. In fact, they dont correlate very much with IQ at all. Theyre about how you feel. Theres a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint Exupery. Hes the author of The Little Prince. He said, If you want to build a ship, dont drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable. But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset. We need to change the way we feel. We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something. We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs. So the question I want to leave you with is. What do you most yearn for. Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs. Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can. Thank you. "
" All the way from Los Altos Hills, California, Mr. Henry Evans. Hello. My name is Henry Evans, and until August 29, 2002, I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids, but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school, I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German, including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart, Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together, we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13, 2001, a fixer upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills, California, from where I am speaking to you now. We were looking forward to rebuilding it, but eight months after we moved in, I suffered a stroke like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40. It took me several years, but with the help of an incredibly supportive family, I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements, and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web, exchange email with people, and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged, mentally active, and feel like I am a part of the world. One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage, and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years, Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years. From my home in California, I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute, both for myself and others in my circumstance. All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour, both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesnt make you any less of a person, and neither does mine. By the way, check out my sweet ride. Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight, giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head, these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof. One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head mounted display, the Oculus Rift, as modified by Fighting Walrus, to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chads group at Brown, I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic, so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer. I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition. Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away. Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately. Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic. Can you show us how excited you are. All right, big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are. All right, we still have a little ways to go with that, but I think it shows the promise. What makes Henrys story amazing is its about understanding Henrys needs, understanding what people in Henrys situation need from technology, and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide, and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What were trying to do is democratize robotics, so that anybody can be a part of this. Were providing affordable, off the shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars, along with open source robotics software so that you can be a part of what were trying to do. And our hope is that, by providing these tools, that youll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled, to provide care for our aging population, to help better educate our children, to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future, to both monitor and protect our environment, and to explore the universe. Back to you, Henry. Thank you, Chad. With this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world, and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better, and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually, thats not true. I would have died. It is up to us, all of us, to decide how robotics will be used, for good or for evil, for simply replacing people or for making people better, for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyones mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality. Thank you. "
"OK, I would like to introduce all of you beautiful, curious minded people to my favorite animal in the world. This is the Peter Pan of the amphibian world. Its an axolotl. Its a type of salamander, but it never fully grows up and climbs out of the water like other salamanders do. And this little guy has X Man style powers, right. So if it loses any limb, it can just completely regenerate. Its amazing. And, I mean, look at it, its got a face with a permanent smile. Its framed by feathery gills. Its just ... how could you not love that. This particular type of axolotl, a very close relative, is known as an achoque. It is equally as cute, and it lives in just one place in a lake in the north of Mexico. Its called Lake Patzcuaro, and as you can see, it is stunningly beautiful. But unfortunately, its been so overfished and so badly polluted that the achoque is dying out altogether. And this is something thats a scenario thats playing out all over the world. Were living through an extinction crisis, and species are particularly vulnerable when theyre evolutionarily tailored to just one little niche or maybe one lake. But this is TED, right. So this is where I give you the big idea, the big solution. So how do you save one special weird species from going extinct. Well, the answer, at least my answer, isnt a grand technological intervention. Its actually really simple. Its that you find people who know all about this animal and you ask them and you listen to them and you work with them, if theyre up for that. So I want to tell you about how Ive seen that in science, and in conservation in particular, if scientists dont team up with local people who have really valuable knowledge but a practical wisdom thats not going to be published in any academic journal, they can really miss the point. Scientists and science as an enterprise can fall at the first hurdle if it rushes in knowing that its the experts that know best. But when scientists shake off those academic constraints and really look to people who have a totally different but really important perspective on what theyre trying to do, it can genuinely save the world, one wonderfully weird amphibian at a time. So, in the case of the achoque, these are the people you need on your team. These are the Sisters of the Immaculate Health. They are nuns who have a convent in Patzcuaro, they live in Patzcuaro, and they have a shared history with the achoque. And it is so mind bogglingly wonderful that it drew me all the way there to make an audio documentary about them, and I even have the unflattering selfie to prove it. There is a room at the center of their convent, though, that looks like this. Its very strange. Its lined with all these tanks full of fresh water and hundreds of achoques. And thats because this creature, because of its regenerative abilities, its believed has healing powers if you consume it. So the sisters actually make and sell a medicine using achoques. I bought a bottle of it. So this is it. It tastes a bit like honey, but the sisters reckon it is good for all kinds of particularly respiratory ailments. So I just want you to have a listen, if you will, to a clip of Sister Ofelia. Our convent was founded by Dominican nuns here in Patzcuaro in 1747. Sometime after that, our sisters started to make the achoque syrup. We didnt discover the properties of the achoque. That was the original people from around here, since ancient times. But we then started to make the syrup, too. The locals knew that, and they came to offer us the animals. I see. So the achoques are part of making that syrup. What does the syrup treat, and what is it for. Its good for coughs, asthma, bronchitis, the lungs and back pain. And so youve harnessed that power in a syrup, in a medicine. Can you tell me how its made. Youre shaking your head and smiling. Yeah, theyre not up for sharing the centuries old secret recipe. But the decline in the achoque actually nearly put a halt to that medicine production altogether, which is why the sisters started this. Its the worlds first achoque farm. All they wanted was a healthy, sustainable population so that they could continue to make that medicine, but what they created at the same time was a captive breeding program for a critically endangered species. And fast forward a few years, and these scientists that you can see in this picture from Chester Zoo all the way over the in UK, not far from where I live, and from Michoacana University in Morelia in Mexico have persuaded the sisters, it took years of careful diplomacy, to join them in a research partnership. So the nuns show the biologists how you rear perfectly healthy, very robust Patzcuaro achoques, and the scientists have put some of their funding into tanks, filters and pumps in this strange, incongruous but amazing room. This is the kind of partnership that can save a species. But I dont think I see enough of this sort of thing, and I have been ludicrously lucky in my job. Ive traveled to loads of places and just basically followed around brilliant people who are trying to use science to answer big questions and solve problems. Ive hung out with scientists who have solved the mystery of the origin of the menopause by tracking killer whales off the north Pacific coast. And Ive followed around scientists whove planted cameras in Antarctic penguin colonies, because they were looking to capture the impacts of climate change as it happens. But its this team that really stuck with me, that really showed me the impact that these delicate but really important relationships can have. And I think the reason that it stuck with me as well is because its not common. And one of the reasons its not common is because our traditional approach of the hierarchical system of academic achievement doesnt exactly encourage the type of humility where scientists will look to nonscientists and really ask for their input. In fact, I think we have a bit of a tradition, especially in the West, of a kind of academically blinkered hubris that has kept science historically an enterprise for the elite. And I think although thats moved on, it continues to be its downfall on occasion. So heres my example from history and my takedown of a scientific hero. Sir Ernest Shackleton and his Trans Antarctic Expedition more than a century ago, the celebrated ill fated adventure. On his way there, Shackleton just didnt listen to the whalers in South Georgia. They knew that region, and they told him you wont get through the ice this year. Its too widespread, its too far north, its too dangerous. And look what happened. I mean, granted, that great adventure, that story of heroic leadership that we still tell, where he saved every single one of his men, we wouldnt be telling that story if hed just hightailed it for home and taken their advice. But it cost him his ship, I would imagine quite a lot of cold injuries among the team, a good few cases of PTSD and Mrs. Chippy, the ships cat, had to be shot because the team couldnt afford any extra food as they fought to survive. Now, that was all a very long time ago, but as Ive prepared for this talk, Ive revisited some of the stories that I have covered, where these really unusual collaborations made a real positive difference. So I spoke to former poachers whose knowledge of where they used to hunt illegally is now really important in conservation projects in those same places. And I spoke to an amazing artist whose own experience of mental health struggles has actually paved the way for him to take a role in designing and creating a new, really innovative and beautiful mental health ward in a hospital. Most recently, I worked here, in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, with a team of scientists that have been working there for decades. One of their experiments growing crops in that area has now turned into this. Its Chernobyls first vodka. Its pretty good, too. Ive tasted it. And this is actually, although it looks like a niche product, its set to be the first consumer product to come out of the exclusion zone since the nuclear accident. And thats actually the result of years of conversation with local communities who still live on the periphery of that abandoned land and want to know when they can, and if they can, safely grow food and build businesses and rebuild their communities and their lives. This was a product of humility, of listening, and I saw that in spades when I visited Patzcuaro. So I watched as a decades experienced conservation biologist called Gerardo Garcia listened and watched super carefully as a nun in a full habit and wimple and latex gloves showed him how, if you tap an achoque on the head really gently, itll open its mouth so you can quickly get a DNA swab with a Q tip. When scientists team up with, look to and defer to people who have a really valuable perspective on what theyre trying to do but a totally different outlook, something really special can happen. Now, there is a truly global and a very, very ambitious example of this called the International Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Now, that is not a snappy title, but stick with me. This organization includes more than 130 countries, and its aiming to do nothing less than assess the state of the natural world across our entire planet. So it recently published this global assessment on the state of nature, and that could be the foundation for an international agreement where all of those nations could sign up to finally take action to tackle the biodiversity crisis thats happening on planet Earth right now. Now, I know from trying to communicate, trying to report on reports like this, on assessments like this for a broad audience, that these big international groups can seem so high level as to be kind of out of reach and nebulous, but theres a group of human beings at the center of them, the reports authors, who have this formidable task of bringing together all of that biological and ecological information that paints a clear and accurate picture of the state of the natural world. And 10 years before this panel even set out to do that, to put that assessment together, they created whats called a cultural concept framework. This is essentially a cultural concept translation dictionary for all of the different ways that we talk about the natural world. So it formally recognizes, for example, that Mother Earth and nature means the same thing. And what that means is that Indigenous and local knowledge can be brought into the same document and given the weight and merit that it deserves in that assessment of what state our natural environment is in. And that is absolutely critical, because an Inuit hunter might never publish in an academic journal, but Ill bet you she knows more about the changes to her home Arctic community because of climate change than a scientist who spent many years going to and from that region taking measurements. And collectively, Indigenous people are the caretakers of an estimated 25 percent of the entire global land surface, including some of the most biodiverse places on the planet. So imagine how much were missing if we dont cross those cultural boundaries, or at least try to, when were trying to figure out how the world works and how to protect it. Every single research proposal is a new opportunity to do exactly that. So what if, every time a research project was proposed, it had to include a suggestion of a person or a group of people, local farmers, Indigenous community leaders, nuns, that researchers wanted to bring into the fold, invite into their team and listen to. I just want to let Sister Ofelia give her view of why she is so particularly driven and dedicated to the survival of the achoque. Sister Ofelia, do you think that saving this species from extinction, is that part of your work for God. Its the responsibility of every human being not to harm those who live around us. Thats all living things. Were all created not only just to survive but to be happy and to make others happy. All of us here are providing happiness by protecting this animal, and were also making Him happy. I feel like I should sort of slink off and let the nuns sing me out, because it sounds so lovely. But did you hear that. Were providing happiness. Now, thats not a protocol youd ever see outlined in any formal research project proposal, but its the impetus behind whats become the most successful breeding program in the world of an animal that was on the very brink of being wiped out. And isnt that just wonderful. Thank you. "
"In half a century of trying to help prevent wars, theres one question that never leaves me. How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return. When youre faced with brutality, whether its a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence, or, on the streets of Syria today, facing tanks and shrapnel, whats the most effective thing to do. Fight back. Give in. Use more force. This question, How do I deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return. has been with me ever since I was a child. I remember I was about 13, glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest, and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down. And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase. And my mother came up and said, What on Earth are you doing. And I said, Im going to Budapest. And she said, What on Earth for. And I said, Kids are getting killed there. Theres something terrible happening. And she said, Dont be so silly. And I started to cry. And she got it, she said, Okay, I see its serious. Youre much too young to help. You need training. Ill help you. But just unpack your suitcase. And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s. But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldnt get from training courses. I wanted to understand how violence, how oppression, works. And what Ive discovered since is this. Bullies use violence in three ways. They use political violence to intimidate, physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine. And only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence. Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence, and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy. And they did it in a total devotion to non violence. They realized that using force against force doesnt work. So what does work. Over time Ive collected about a half dozen methods that do work, of course there are many more, that do work and that are effective. And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here, inside me. Its my response, my attitude, to oppression that Ive got control over, and that I can do something about. And what I need to develop is self knowledge to do that. That means I need to know how I tick, when I collapse, where my formidable points are, where my weaker points are. When do I give in. What will I stand up for. And meditation or self inspection is one of the ways, again its not the only one, its one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power. And my heroine here, like Satishs, is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon. They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns. And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her. But she told the students to sit down. And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it. And no one got killed. So thats what the mastery of fear can do, not only faced with machine guns, but if you meet a knife fight in the street. But we have to practice. So what about our fear. I have a little mantra. My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it. And if it grows very big it probably happens. So we all know the three oclock in the morning syndrome, when something youve been worrying about wakes you up, I see a lot of people, and for an hour you toss and turn, it gets worse and worse, and by four oclock youre pinned to the pillow by a monster this big. The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you. Youre the adult. The fear is the child. And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs. How can this be made better. How can the child feel stronger. And you make a plan. And you say, Okay, now were going back to sleep. Half past seven, were getting up and thats what were going to do. I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday, paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you. So I did the thing. I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all and Im here, still partly paralyzed, but Im here. So thats fear. What about anger. Wherever there is injustice theres anger. But anger is like gasoline, and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match, youve got an inferno. But anger as an engine, in an engine, is powerful. If we can put our anger inside an engine, it can drive us forward, it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power. And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers. Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong. Totally ineffective. In order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger. Its okay to be angry with the thing, the nuclear weapons in this case, but it is hopeless to be angry with the people. They are human beings just like us. And theyre doing what they think is best. And thats the basis on which we have to talk with them. So thats the third one, anger. And it brings me to the crux of whats going on, or what I perceive as going on, in the world today, which is that last century was top down power. It was still governments telling people what to do. This century theres a shift. Its bottom up or grassroots power. Its like mushrooms coming through concrete. Its people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away to bring about change. And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do. They know best what to do. So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that. And the kind of thing theyre doing is demobilizing militias, rebuilding economies, resettling refugees, even liberating child soldiers. And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this. And what theyve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane, but its less effective than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild. And I think that the U.S. military is finally beginning to get this. Up to now their counter terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost, and if civilians get in the way, thats written as collateral damage. And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan, that it makes the recruitment for al Qaeda very easy, when people are so disgusted by, for example, the burning of the Koran. So the training of the troops has to change. And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change. The British military have always been much better at this. But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from, and thats a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes. And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf, in Iraq actually, and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road, screaming, yelling, furiously angry, and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified, didnt know what was going on, couldnt speak Arabic. And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground, and he said, Kneel. And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor, wobbled to the ground. And complete silence fell. And after about two minutes, everybody moved aside and went home. Now that to me is wisdom in action. In the moment, thats what he did. And its happening everywhere now. You dont believe me. Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years. Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mali, Madagascar, Poland, the Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on, and now Tunisia and Egypt. And this hasnt just happened. A lot of it is due to a book written by an 80 year old man in Boston, Gene Sharp. He wrote a book called From Dictatorship to Democracy with 81 methodologies for non violent resistance. And its been translated into 26 languages. Its flown around the world. And its being used by young people and older people everywhere, because it works and its effective. So this is what gives me hope, not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now. Because finally human beings are getting it. Were getting practical, doable methodologies to answer my question. How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug. Were using the kind of skills that Ive outlined, inner power, the development of inner power, through self knowledge, recognizing and working with our fear, using anger as a fuel, cooperating with others, banding together with others, courage, and most importantly, commitment to active non violence. Now I dont just believe in non violence. I dont have to believe in it. I see evidence everywhere of how it works. And I see that we, ordinary people, can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did. We can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known. And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve. And this open heartedness is exactly what Ive experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday. Thank you. "
"Its a great honor to be here with you. The good news is Im very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because Im the only thing standing between you and the bar. And the good news is I dont have a prepared speech, but I have a box of slides. I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living. Ive learned through experience that people remember pictures long after theyve forgotten words, and so I hope youll remember some of the pictures Im going to share with you for just a few minutes. The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead. And on a Wednesday afternoon, I was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching, who made a great big old ceramic vessel, and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room, and if youve ever seen clay done, its magic, and Id never seen anything like that before in my life. So, I walked in the art room and I said, What is that. And he said, Ceramics. And who are you. And I said, Im Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that. And he said, Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here, and Ill teach it to you. And so for the remaining two years of my high school, I cut all my classes. But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers classes that I cut the pottery that I made, and they gave me passing grades. And thats how I got out of high school. And Mr. Ross said, Youre too smart to die and I dont want it on my conscience, so Im leaving this school and Im taking you with me. And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation. Well, Im now a trustee of the university, and at my installation ceremony I said, Im the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation. Dont give up on the poor kids, because you never know whats going to happen to those children in life. What Im going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the highest crime rate. One is called Bidwell Training Center, it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers. You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh. Well, we dont make any steel anymore, and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it. And I rebuild them and give them new life. Manchester Craftsmens Guild is named after my neighborhood. I was adopted by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots, and he donated a row house. And in that row house I started Manchester Craftsmens Guild, and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians, theres money in very close proximity. And the Bishop adopted me as his kid. And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life. I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect, and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh. And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport. And when you come to Pittsburgh, and youre all invited, youll be flying into the blown up version of my building. Thats the building. Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead. My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on, you have to look like the solution and not the problem. As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard. And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there. And now that Im giving speeches at conferences like TED, I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum. At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain. Well, I think that welfare mothers and at risk kids and ex steel workers deserve a fountain in their life. And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you, water is life and water of human possibility, and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech. So, from that fountain I built this building. As you can see, it has world class art, and its all my taste because I raised all the money. I said to my boy, When you raise the money, well put your taste on the wall. That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns, theres something beautiful looking back at you, thats deliberate. Thats intentional. In my view, it is this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor people. We also created a boardroom, and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan, and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building. We have since spun him off into his own business. Hes making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people. And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school because I felt that welfare moms and ex steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day. Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech. We even have flowers in the hallway, and theyre not plastic. Those are real and theyre in my building every day. And now that Ive given lots of speeches, we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me, and they said, Mr. Strickland, what an extraordinary story and what a great school. And we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there. I said, Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there. You dont need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids. What you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life. The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge. And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers, we believe in hope and human possibilities. That happens to be at Christmas time. And so the next thing youll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the Heinz company, youve heard of them. They did all right in the ketchup business. And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator, who was tragically killed in a plane accident, he had heard about my desire to build a new building, because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. And he called me into his office, which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz, and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents. And he said, But weve heard about you. Weve heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers, and were inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building. And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program. Because back then, we were building a trades program. He said, That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company. I said, Senator, Im reluctant to go into a field that I dont know much about, but I promise you that if youll support my school, Ill get it built and in a couple of years, Ill come back and weigh out that program that you desire. And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said, Well, what would your reaction be if I said Id give you a million dollars. I said, Senator, it appears that were going into the food training business. And John Heinz did give me a million bucks. And most importantly, he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company. And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America, which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools, and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city. And weve never looked back. I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen. That happens to be our cafeteria line. Thats puff pastry day. Why. Because the students made puff pastry and thats what the school ate every day. But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food. That good foods not for rich people, good foods for everybody on the planet, and theres no excuse why we all cant be eating it. So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because weve discovered that its good for their stomachs, but its better for their heads. Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center. We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids, and what weve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment, because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way. These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program. No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history. What weve discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they dont have any money, which happens to be a curable condition. Its all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior. That was done by a student after seven months in the program, done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef. Ive actually eaten seven of those baskets and theyre very good. They have no calories. Thats our dining room. It looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in America. But this is my view of how students ought to be treated, particularly once they have been pushed aside. We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry, we train medical technicians for the medical industry, and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon. And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh, and youre all invited, youll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators 10 months from enrolling in the program. There is absolutely no reason why poor people cant learn world class technology. What weve discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbies music, and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time. We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry. We even teach people how to read. The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago, hes now an instructor. And I have children with high school diplomas that they cant read. And so you must ask yourself the question, how is it possible in the 21st century that we graduate children from schools who cant read the diplomas that they have in their hands. The reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read. I can take these children and in 20 weeks, demonstrated aptitude. I can get them high school equivalent. No big deal. Thats our library with more handcrafted furniture. And this is the arts program I started in 1968. Remember Im the black kid from the 60s who got his life saved with ceramics. Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood, the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm, you can bring them right back to life. I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education. And these are children who are flunking out of public school. And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college and Ive averaged over 80 percent for 15 years. Weve made a fascinating discovery, theres nothing wrong with the kids that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbies music cant cure. For that I won a big old plaque, Man of the Year in Education. I beat out all the Ph.D.s because I figured that if you treat children like human beings, it increases the likelihood theyre going to behave that way. And why we cant institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me. Let me show you what these people do. We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging. And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent, no imagination. And we bring in the worlds greatest artists, Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there, and what weve learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them. In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican, an African American woman who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques, and let me show you what they did with the work. These were children who the whole world had given up on, who were flunking out of public school, and thats what theyre capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence. We teach photography. And these are examples of some of the kids work. That boy won a four year scholarship on the strength of that photograph. This is our gallery. We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery, so I designed this thing. We have smoked salmon at the art openings, we have a formal printed invitation, and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come. I couldnt buy a parent 15 years ago so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time. He was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the Lord. And I said, Bill, I want to hire you, man. You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit, but keep the enthusiasm. I cant get these parents to come to the school. He said, Ill get them to come to the school. So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones house and said, Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kids art opening but you probably didnt have a ride. So, I came to give you a ride. And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents. At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up and we didnt pick up one parent. Because now its become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmens Guild because people think youre bad parents. And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents. Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated, every time, every town, every city. I wanted you to see this gallery because its as good as it gets. And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school, theyve got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because its all up here. You have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior. And its worked out pretty good up to this day. I even stuck another room on the building, which Id like to show you. This is brand new. We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference. I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley and I did all right. And the woman came out of the audience, she said, That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation. My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old. And I said, Well, what do you do for a living. She said, Well, I work for a company called Hewlett Packard. And I said, Youre in the computer business, is that right. She said, Yes, sir. And I said, Well, theres an easy solution to that problem. Well, Im very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company called Steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America. And thats the room thats initiating the relationship. We got it just done in time to show you, so its kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center. I only have a couple more slides, and this is where the story gets kind of interesting. So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and youll understand why hes there and Im here. In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it. And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby. And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said, Dizzy, why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesnt even have a reputation in music. He said, Because I heard you built the center and I didnt believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself. And now that I have, I want to give you a gift. I said, Youre the gift. He said, No, sir. Youre the gift. And Im going to allow you to record the concert and Im going to give you the music, and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school. And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later, but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing. And he showed up and said, Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man, and I want to help you. And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up. Then a bass player named Ray Brown, and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine, and a piano player named Herbie Hancock, and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra, and a fellow named Tito Puente, and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter, and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city. And Im very pleased to tell you that, with their permission, I have now accumulated 600 recordings of the greatest artists in the world, including Joe Williams, who died, but not before his last recording was done at my school. And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, Gods picked you, man, to do this work. And I want my music to be with you. And that worked out all right. When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music. And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy. And like a fool, I didnt go to the ceremony because I didnt think we were going to win. Well, we did win, and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden. Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back. So, weve become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate. Thats the place all filled up with Republicans. If youd have dropped a bomb on that room, youd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there. Including my mother and father, who lived long enough to see their kid build that building. And theres Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there. And he was there, Tito Puente. And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there and they recorded with us. And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet. We put the mops in the hallway and reengineered the thing and thats where we recorded the first Grammy. And this is our new facility, which is all video technology. And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson, who recorded that album at our school last Christmas. And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there singing excerpts from this album, the rights to which she donated to our school. And I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs. We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts, right behind Tony Bennett. And I think were going to be fine. This was burned out during the riots, this is next to my building, and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again. And thats the building, and thats the model, and on the rights a high tech greenhouse and in the middles the medical technology building. And Im very pleased to tell you that the buildings done. Its also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot, triple that in the middle of the inner city. And theres the fountain. Every building has a fountain. And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants and they took half the building, and we now train medical technicians through all their system. And Mellon Banks a tenant. And I love them because they pay the rent on time. And as a result of the association, Im now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that bought Dreyfus. And this is in the process of being built as we speak. Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse thats going to open in October this year because were going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city. And were going to have high school kids growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city. And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states. And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California, who are Hispanic. So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city. And I told my United States senator that there was a very high probability that if he could find some funding for this, we would become a left hand column in the Wall Street Journal, to which he readily agreed. And we got the funding and we open in the fall. And you ought to come and see it, its going to be a hell of a story. And this is what I want to do when I grow up. The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and Ill tell you where I made my big mistake. I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park, which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront, for four million dollars and I didnt do it. And I built the first building, and guess what happened. I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybodys expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year, and said, Mr. Strickland, you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award because youve appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations. Thank you very much for that. The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams, just in case they do come true. And finally, theres this picture. This is in a place called San Francisco. And the reason this pictures in here is I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit, and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me. He said, Man, thats a great story. I want one of those. I said, Well, Im very flattered. What do you do for a living. He says, I run the city of San Francisco. My names Willie Brown. And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind. And that weekend, I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night, first time Id met him. And he walked in and he says, What is this. And I said, Herbie, this is my concept of a training center for poor people. And he said, As God as my witness, Ive had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and youve built it. And now I really want to build one. I said, Well, where would you build this thing. He said, San Francisco. I said, Any chance you know Willie Brown. As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown, and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago, and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth. And Willie Brown said, As sure as Im the mayor of San Francisco, Im going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city. And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board, and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase, and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech. And along the way, I met this real short guy at my slide show in the Silicon Valley. He came up to me afterwards, he said, Man, thats a fabulous story. I want to help you. And I said, Well, thank you very much for that. What do you do for a living. He said, Well, I built a company called eBay. I said, Well, thats very nice. Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime well talk. I didnt know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano, but I had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center. I said, Hey man, what is eBay. He said, Well, thats the electronic commerce network. I said, Well, I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card. So, I called him up on the phone and I said, Mr. Skoll, Ive come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are and Id like to become your friend. And Jeff and I did become friends, and hes organized a team of people and were going to build this center. And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview Hunters Point, and I said, The mayor sent me down here to work with you and I want to build a center with you, but Im not going to build you anything if you dont want it. And all Ive got is a box of slides. And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken and it was 100 degrees outside, and I started showing these pictures. And after about 10 pictures they all settled down. And I ran the story and I said, What do you think. And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said, In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place, youre the only person thats come down here and treated us with dignity. Im going with you, man. And she turned that audience around on a pin. And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing, and were going to build it all right. And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh. But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way and I showed him the box of slides. And Quincy said, I want to help you, man. Lets do one in L.A. And so hes assembled a group of people. And Ive fallen in love with him, as I have with Herbie and with his music. And Quincy said, Where did the idea for centers like this come from. And I said, It came from your music, man. Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums when I was 16 years old in the pottery class, when the world was all dark, and your music got me to the sunlight. And I said, If I can follow that music, Ill get out into the sunlight and Ill be OK. And if thats not true, how did I get here. I want you all to know that I think the world is a place thats worth living. I believe in you. I believe in your hopes and your dreams, I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm. And Im tired of living like this, going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged. We wont make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around. In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail, most of whom look like me. Its 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School. Its 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail. Do the math, it will never work. I am banking on you and Im banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something. And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town. And I dont think Im crazy. I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than were spending on prisons. And I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope. In my business its very difficult work. Youre always fighting upstream like a salmon, never enough money, too much need, and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work. And so Ive figured out, over time, the solution to the depression, you make a friend in every town and youll never be lonely. And my hope is that Ive made a few here tonight. And thanks for listening to what I had to say. "
"Im going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we dont understand as much as we think we do. Id like to begin with four questions. This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year. Thats an in joke, by the way. But these four questions, actually, are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard. And theyre questions that Ive asked of science television producers, of audiences of science educators, so thats science teachers, and also of seven year olds, and I find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising. So the first question, and you might want to write this down, either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well. A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right. I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair, right. Where does all this stuff come from. And your next question is, can you light a little torch bulb with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire. And would you be able to, kind of, draw a, you dont have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it. Or would you just say, thats actually not possible. The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter. I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter, but why. And finally, would you be able to, and you can sort of scribble it, if you like, scribble a plan diagram of the solar system, showing the shape of the planets orbits. Would you be able to do that. And if you can, just scribble a pattern. OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers, as teachers often think, but actually from common sense, from experience of the world around them, from all the things that go on between them and their peers, and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience. And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him, Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into peoples heads because its virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right. Im not quite sure how he died, actually. Was he beheaded in the end, or hung. Now, those questions, which, of course, youve got right, and you havent been conferring, and so on. And I, you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate, but maybe not in this instance. A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff, 99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air. Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe its fewer at TED, will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people, probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards, and say that actually, it comes out of the ground. Now, if that was true, wed have trucks going round the country, filling peoples gardens in with soil, itd be a fantastic business. But, actually, we dont do that. The mass of this comes out of the air. Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain. I passed them really well, but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground. Second one, can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire. Yes, you can, and Ill show you in a second how to do that. Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately, the sound doesnt work in this room, so Im going to describe to you, in true Monty Python fashion, what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. We chose MIT because, obviously, thats a very long way away from here, and you wouldnt mind too much, but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions of science graduates, and they couldnt answer them. And so, theres a whole lot of people saying, Id be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air. Thats very surprising to me. And those are science graduates. And we intercut it with, We are the premier science university in the world, because of British like hubris. And when we gave graduate engineers that question, they said it couldnt be done. And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb, and said, Can you do it. They couldnt do it. Right. And thats no different from Imperial College in London, by the way, its not some sort of anti American thing going on. As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people, we might as well get it right. And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is thats happening in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation, as Im very conscious as a trustee of Kew, is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Thats what plants actually do for a living. And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun, we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice if we dont understand that kind of thing. Now, heres how you do the battery and the bulb. Its so easy, isnt it. Of course, you all knew that. But if you havent played with a battery and a bulb, if youve only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and thats one of the problems. So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter. We learn, as children, that you get closer to something thats hot, and it burns you. Its a very powerful bit of learning, and it happens pretty early on. By extension, we think to ourselves, Why its hotter in summer than in winter must be because were closer to the Sun. I promise you that most of you will have got that. Oh, youre all shaking your heads, but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly. Other ones are kind of going like this. All right. Its hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth. And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isnt. The Sun is 93 million miles away, and were tilting like this, right. It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere, were further from the Sun in summer, as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference. OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system. If you believe, as most of you probably do, that its hotter in summer than in winter because were closer to the Sun, you must have drawn an ellipse. Right. That would explain it, right. Except, in your, youre nodding, now, in your ellipse, have you thought, Well, what happens during the night. Between Australia and here, right, theyve got summer and weve got winter, and what, does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night, and then rush back again. I mean, its a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of whats right and what isnt right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields. So, heres Copernicus view of what the solar system looked like as a plan. Thats pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right. And this is NASAs view. Theyre stunningly similar. I hope you notice the coincidence here. What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception, right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children. What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system, to show that its not really like that. Youd show them something like this, wouldnt you. Its a plan, looking down from above. But, no, look what I found in the textbooks. Thats what you show people, right. These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites, and almost anything you pick up is like that. And the reason its like that is because its dead boring to have a load of concentric circles, whereas thats much more exciting, to look at something at that angle, isnt it. Right. And by doing it at that angle, if youve got that misconception in your head, then that two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing will be ellipses. So youve, its crap, isnt it really. As we say. So, these mental models, we look for evidence that reinforces our models. We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else, and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look, and scientists do it, constantly, we look for evidence that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models. So, being Im in the United States, Ill have a dig at the Europeans. These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed, theres a lot of mediation by glass, and its very blue, and kind of professional, in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in Annie Hall, and said, God, thats so professional. And that you dont, theres no passion in it, and its not hands on, right, and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation, Ill use an example from nearby, is San Francisco Exploratorium, where all the things that, the demonstrations, and so on, are made out of everyday objects that children can understand, its very hands on, and they can engage with, and experiment with. And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it, they would have learned how it actually works, rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and cant do it. So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right. And things that, where there isnt an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium, and it all looks fantastic, OK. And the Exploratorium does that really, really well. And its amateur, but amateur in the best sense, in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion. So, children are not empty vessels, OK. So, as Monty Python would have it, this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so, but this is, children are not empty vessels. They come with their own ideas and their own theories, and unless you work with those, then you wont be able to shift them, right. And I probably havent shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates, either. But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology. For example, we are, in Britain, were trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology for television. And its one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works, its quite difficult to shift those. So were not empty vessels, the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood. Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better by children before theyve been to school than afterwards, OK. Same for gravity, two concepts, so its, which is quite humbling, as a, you know, if youre a teacher, and you look before and after, thats quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching. And we collude. We design tests, or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right. And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. OK. We collude, and actually if you, if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams, to really understand, to see whether Id understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue, and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air, then I might have done better at science. So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models. Your homework is, you know, how does an aircrafts wing create lift. An obvious question, and youll have an answer now in your heads. And the second question to that then is, ensure youve explained how it is that planes can fly upside down. Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue. All right. And youve all got an idea in your head of the answer. So, why is it blue on cloudy days. Ah, see. Ive always wanted to say that in this country. Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because its by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. Its not a replacement, its just part of learning thats important. Thank you very much. Now, oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on. "
"Id like to start by showing you someone who is dressed even worse than I am. You may notice, aside from the color harmony, a tattoo saying, My body belongs to me. But who is this person. Is it a punk, who borrowed clothes from their grandmothers wardrobe. Is it a teenager, from the 16th arrondissement of Paris, who feels like rebelling. No. This is our Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, standing on the steps of the Elysee. And this was last year, to celebrate the 40th year of the Veil Abortion Act, which enables women to take control of their bodies, through a voluntary interruption of their pregnancy. My body belongs to me has become banal, everyone says it. By the way, for once, the entire National Assembly has voted in favor of a symbolic law in order to reapprove the Veil Law. Its a banality, even ministers have it tattooed on their arm. However, its not entirely true. I would like to give you a few examples, that are a little extreme, honestly even shocking, which will demonstrate that for many people and in a lot of cases, well, my body doesnt belong to me. Firstly, it doesnt belong to me as long as Im alive. I am not allowed to rent my belly. I am not allowed in many countries to sell my sexuality. I am not allowed to define the gender that I belong to, since I have to face a doctor or be in front of a judge, and declare to the civil registrar whether I am a man, woman, or other. I am also not allowed to do whatever I want with my body. For instance, I cant do this. So, You might recognize Leonardo Di Caprio, in this great dwarf tossing scene. But some versions of it exist that are a little less chic, notably the one that was practiced by the great community of Morsang sur Orge from lEssonne, in the beginning of the 90s. The mayor of Morsang sur Orge said, This cant go on, we cant toss dwarfs. And so he prohibited dwarf tossing. And who was to protest. Dwarf tossers found other activities to do on Sundays. They probably went back to fishing. Its the dwarves themselves who protested, because they had a breadwinner, and a certain renown, apparently a certain success with women. And the Morsang sur Orges Council of States decision, which jurists know well, said, No, this is forbidden. I also cannot do whatever I want with my body in order to die. I am not allowed to be euthanized, but I am also not allowed to be eaten. In 2001, a charming German engineer posted an announcement saying, I am looking for a volunteer to eat. He received several candidates, made a selection, conducted a few final interviews, and in the end finally found Bernt, who agreed wholeheartedly. So they began by cutting off Bernts genital and eating it together, probably by candlelight. Obviously satisfied by this first course, they chose to proceed, and by the way this all on video so you can watch it. I recommend it to you, its really nice, Armine ate Bernt. But be aware that this is prohibited. Its crazy, considering they havent hurt anyone. But it is indeed prohibited to be eaten. Well, even after my death I cant do whatever I want with my body. For instance, I am not allowed to practice sea immersion whereas diving is allowed while I am alive. I am also not allowed to be embalmed, unless my name is Lenin, Mao, or Valery Giscard dEstaing. And I am also not allowed, and this is even worse, to be cryogenized. You know, some people, have themselves frozen, hoping that in 10 years, 100 years, or a million years, we would defrost them, as by then we will have already found ways to resuscitate them, or found cures to the illnesses that have killed them. This has been somewhat a success. In Russia and the United States, there are some cryogenic sites, where one can see the coffins. Some put their entire body, while others only their head, its cheaper. And in France, a doctor named Martineau, felt that it was a great idea to freeze his wife first. And as it seemed to be going well, he decided to follow her with the freezing. Forever united in a frozen sleep, inside a castle. And then someone found out and filed a complaint. There are some people frozen in the village, do you realize that. Their son was delighted. He would go to see them from time to time. Its better than gathering around a grave. And the Council of State, that same one, said, This cant be happening. You need to defrost and burn them. Put it all on fire. Then there was a trial, and Martineaus son was forced to burn his parents. Can you imagine, this poor couple who imagined being united for millions of years and resuscitate in a future where sexuality is completely open, completely vivified and rejuvenated. Well, unfortunately, there is only a heap of ashes left. So behind these tragedies, they dont concern us all if we dont wish to be eaten, frozen, or tossed, who cares. But the problem is that it actually applies to each one of us. Its the Civil Code via the bioethics law of 1994 that says so. The conventions, as you can read, are that there is no private ownership or patrimoniality over the body, because we say that the person is unavailable under law. And so the body itself isnt patrimonial. You dont have an ownership of your body. And so you might tell me, So what, everything in France is forbidden anyway. But even in the US, a country supposedly liberal, its the same story. It has, by the way, been declared very clearly at a trial in the Supreme Court of California. The John Moore case. John Moore was a patient suffering from leukemia, in the 80s, and the doctors had to remove his spleen. They discovered that his cells had extraordinary properties for producing certain kind of proteins. So the doctors extracted, without telling John Moore, many of his cells. They extracted blood, sperm, and parts of the spinal cord. They apparently told him that in order to treat his leukemia they had to remove some sperm, thats apparently what happened. And they made a cell line out of it. John Moores cell line. Which they then sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars to big pharmaceutical institutions. And John Moore, upon realizing what has happened, said, Wait a minute, I dont get to have a say. These are my cells, if you dont mind. And so there was a big trial, and the judge concluded that, no, they arent his cells in fact, given that he doesnt have ownership over his cells. So, where does all of this come from. There are good reasons to think that it came from a monotheistic heritage. This idea, as Saint Paul put it, The body is for the Lord and the Lord is for the body., is that in the big monotheism, particularly within Judeo Christian religions, my body doesnt belong to me because it belongs to God. My body is the expression of the soul, as per Thomas dAquin. The body is the reflection of my soul, my soul is immortal. It joins the kingdom of heaven. By the way, I can even be resuscitated if the Council of State hasnt burned me first. Pope Pie XII has claimed it very explicitly, this is the first time Im quoting Pope Pie XII publicly. In 1954, at a medical congress, he explained that Man is merely a usufructuary of his body, not its full owner. So within our secular law system, a secularized system, it is not a matter of God anymore, well the concept of God has been replaced by the concept of dignity. Going back to that trial in Morsang sur Orge, this is the reason why the Council of State has prohibited dwarf tossing, because a human beings dignity is viewed as being part of the public order. It means that today, this transcendence we have abolished, this divine transcendence, is being retaken by the State, or by society if you prefer, defining everyones dignity. So dignity is sacredness without God. Its the idea that, nonetheless, the body is sacred. We cannot do whatever we want with it. I suggest that you try and go to the end of the modernity logic. And if we are really, completely within immanence, to whom does the body belong, if not to me. Who can define its dignity, if not me. Thats what John Lock did, not John Moore, but John Locke. Indeed, there are many Johns. He was the first person to have written, to my knowledge, that each person has ownership over their own personhood. Its not a coincidence that he is the one who wrote that, He was a doctor, and well acquainted with flesh, the bodys reactions. And also because he was in the midst of the glorious British revolution, the Bill of Rights Revolution. So this whole theory about social contract rights, about elementary, fundamental rights, about civil disobedience, also means that one has natural rights that are predetermined among which, the right of ownership of oneself. He went even further by saying, If can have ownership over exterior things, if I can acquire the world by working on it, by adding value to it,, this idea of property was first born out of the appropriation of myself. And think about it, if we have ownership over the body, we have, according to classical themes, the usus, fructus and abusus. Usus means, its always nice using Latin terms, usus means usage. So if I have usus over the body, the dwarfs can do their work with dignity. Then, fructus, we have it fructified and so John Moore can have access to his cell money. And then you have abusus, I can abuse it and do whatever I want with it, and if I want to have it cryogenized, thats my problem. It appears to me that this new generation is a generation that rejects predetermined structures, one that wants to define their own career, that wants to define their life by traveling, and to build themselves, their own self, be their own creator. And we can see, anecdotally, sociologically, to what extent this generation who appropriates their own body with tattoos for instance, Its also a way to define ones sexuality in a much more fluid way. There is a study that came out which showed that generation Z, its not even Y anymore, its Z, Generation Z is post gender. Its not even bi anymore, everyone defines their own sexuality by adding a little bit of this or that. So this results in many things. For instance, one can be half sexual, Grey sexual, gyno sexual, pan sexual, Strauss Kahn sexual, No, not that. Anyway, there are many versions. I dont know all of them, and cant describe them on stage. But its interesting, you should look them up. And more importantly, it will allow us to tackle the three big themes of the future. The subject of human augmentation, the enhancement of oneself, the theme of transhumanism, and the theme of data. If tomorrow I can, and I already can enhance myself, thats to say building my own artificial arms, enhancing my limbs, enhancing my brain abilities, even modifying my own DNA. If I modify my own DNA, I must be its owner. If tomorrow I want to test, I want to explore immortality, be it through cryogenisation, here is that nice example again. Or for instance, as Ray Kurzweil, the Pope of transhumanism, envisions it, by transferring my consciousness onto a USB key. Well, similarly, I am going to define, even contractually, the way in which my body relates to the world. And then there is a third question that might seem a little marginal, the question of data. We produce, a large amount of data, and its value is humongous. as in Europe, its estimated be worth a thousand billion euros by 2020. However, this data, which is worth so much money and with which some companies make so much money, well, your personal data doesnt belong to you. In the same way there isnt a patrimoniality of the body, there isnt a patrimoniality of data. For the exact same reasons, because data is considered to be an expression of your personality, and as we saw, within the law, the personality is inalienable and the body isnt patrimonial. If tomorrow we find, that we are able to build a private property for data, which will be to the digital age what intellectual property was to the industrial revolution, you will then become an owner, in truly legal and financial terms, of your own data, which you will be able to negotiate. In other words, you will finally get paid for using Facebook. So, my body belongs to me isnt a platitude. Its a tattoo we would finally all wear. Because this brand new generation will have to confront all these problems. Transhumanism is coming, bioethical committees are already outdated. And in order for everyone to able to choose their own values, in this complex universe, we must first own our own bodies. Thank you."
"I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. And I think it starts with one physician, and thats me. And maybe Ive been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that. Before I actually begin the meat of my talk, lets begin with a bit of baseball. Hey, why not. Were near the end, were getting close to the World Series. We all love baseball, dont we. Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. And theres hundreds of them. Moneyball is about to come out, and its all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team. Im going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of. Its called batting average. So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300. That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely three times out of 10 at bats. That means hit the ball into the outfield, it dropped, it didnt get caught, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didnt get there in time and the runner was safe. Three times out of 10. Do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball. Good, really good, maybe an all star. Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter. Thats somebody who hit, by the way, four times safely out of every 10. Legendary, as in Ted Williams legendary, the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season. Now lets take this back into my world of medicine where Im a lot more comfortable, or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what Im going to talk to you about. Suppose you have appendicitis and youre referred to a surgeon whos batting 400 on appendectomies. Somehow this isnt working out, is it. Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist whos batting 200 on angioplasties. But, but, you know what. Shes doing a lot better this year. Shes on the comeback trail. And shes hitting a 257. Somehow this isnt working. But Im going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon, an OBGYN, a paramedic is supposed to be. 1,000, very good. Now truth of the matter is, nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat. What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself, out into the world with the admonition, be perfect. Never ever, ever make a mistake, but you worry about the details, about how thats going to happen. And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school. I was an obsessive compulsive student. In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. And so I did. And I studied in my little garret at the nurses residence at Toronto General Hospital, not far from here. And I memorized everything. I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle, every branch of every artery that came off the aorta, differential diagnoses obscure and common. I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. And all the while, I was amassing more and more knowledge. And I did well, I graduated with honors, cum laude. And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes. And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker. I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working. At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation. And it was my job, when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult, to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending. And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless. And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound. And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope, I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart fails, and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood, and thats why you have shortness of breath. And that wasnt a difficult diagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her. I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills, to get her to pee out the access fluid. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better. And I felt really good. And thats when I made my first mistake. I sent her home. Actually, I made two more mistakes. I sent her home without speaking to my attending. I didnt pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself. And he knew her, he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason. Maybe I didnt want to be a high maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attendings patients without even having to contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home, I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me, Goldman, not a good idea. Dont do this. In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker, Do you think its okay if she goes home. And the nurse thought about it and said very matter of factly, Yeah, I think shell do okay. I can remember that like it was yesterday. So I signed the discharge papers, and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards. All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work. And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I dont usually do. I walked through the emergency department on my way home. And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well, but theres something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly. The three words are. Do you remember. Do you remember that patient you sent home. the other nurse asked matter of factly. Well shes back, in just that tone of voice. Well she was back all right. She was back and near death. About an hour after she had arrived home, after Id sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathing and she was blue. And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked and shaken to the core. And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover. And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up. She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered. And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselves to what was happening. And at about the nine day mark, they let her go, Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother. They say you never forget the names of those who die. And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine, where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you cant talk about it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say, Ill never make that mistake again. And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. Thats the kind of shame that is a teacher. The unhealthy shame Im talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. Its the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasnt because of my attending, he was a doll. He talked to the family, and Im quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didnt get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions. Why didnt I ask my attending. Why did I send her home. And then at my worst moments. Why did I make such a stupid mistake. Why did I go into medicine. Slowly but surely, it lifted. I began to feel a bit better. And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year old man with a sore throat. It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here. I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way. And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and thats when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. And she said the three words. Do you remember. Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat. Well it turns out, he didnt have a strep throat. He had a potentially life threatening condition called epiglottitis. You can Google it, but its an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually cause the airway to close. And fortunately he didnt die. He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again. Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night. Now in both cases, I didnt send them home and I dont think there was any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone. I ordered a kidney X ray. When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea. I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons. In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay. But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me. And Id like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S. Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. Alone, ashamed and unsupported. Heres the problem. If I cant come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I cant find the still small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues. How can I teach them about what I did so that they dont do the same thing. If I were to walk into a room, like right now, I have no idea what you think of me. When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure. Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but youre not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what Ive just told you right now, I probably wouldnt get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, theyd change the subject and we would move on. And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, Id have trouble making eye contact with that person. Thats the system that we have. Its a complete denial of mistakes. Its a system in which there are two kinds of physicians, those who make mistakes and those who dont, those who cant handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes. And its almost like an ideological reaction, like the antibodies begin to attack that person. And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system. But there are two problems with that. In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, Ive made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show White Coat, Black Art. And what Ive learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital acquired infections are getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death. In this country, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors. In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000. In both cases, these are gross underestimates, because we really arent ferreting out the problem as we should. And heres the thing. In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we cant keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We cant get rid of it. We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. I dont take the same history. Im not a robot. I dont do things the same way each time. And my patients arent cars, they dont tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable. So if you take the system, as I was taught, and weed out all the error prone health professionals, well there wont be anybody left. And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases. On my show, on White Coat, Black Art, I made it a habit of saying, Heres my worst mistake, I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, Heres my worst mistake, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, What about yours. and I would point the microphone towards them. And their pupils would dilate, they would recoil, then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories. They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. They want to be able to say, Look, dont make the same mistake I did. What they need is an environment to be able to do that. What they need is a redefined medical culture. And it starts with one physician at a time. The redefined physician is human, knows shes human, accepts it, isnt proud of making mistakes, but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else. She shares her experience with others. Shes supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. And she points out other peoples mistakes, not in a gotcha way, but in a loving, supportive way so that everybody can benefit. And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time. So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, were rewarded for coming clean. My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. Im human. I make mistakes. Im sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people. I still dont know what you think of me, but I can live with that. And let me close with three words of my own. I do remember. "
"I am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon, and my research focuses on usable privacy and security, and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing systems, especially frustrations related to unusable privacy and security. So passwords are something that I hear a lot about. A lot of people are frustrated with passwords, and its bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess. But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and youre supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems. Its tough. At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords. The password requirement up through 2009 was just that you had to have a password with at least one character. Pretty easy. But then they changed things, and at the end of 2009, they announced that we were going to have a new policy, and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long, with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, a digit, a symbol, you couldnt use the same character more than three times, and it wasnt allowed to be in a dictionary. Now, when they implemented this new policy, a lot of people, my colleagues and friends, came up to me and they said, Wow, now thats really unusable. Why are they doing this to us, and why didnt you stop them. And I said, Well, you know what. They didnt ask me. But I got curious, and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy, and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities, and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements, and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy. Now entropy is a complicated term, but basically it measures the strength of passwords. But the thing is, there isnt actually a standard measure of entropy. Now, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy, but they dont have anything too specific, and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they dont actually have any good data on passwords. In fact, their report states, Unfortunately, we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules. NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose, but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others. So this is a problem, but our research group looked at it as an opportunity. We said, Well, theres a need for good password data. Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here. So the first thing we did is, we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students, faculty and staff, and asked them for information about their passwords. Now we didnt say, Give us your password. No, we just asked them about their password. How long is it. Does it have a digit. Does it have a symbol. And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week. So we got results from 470 students, faculty and staff, and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying, but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords. We found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down, and only 13 percent of them did, but disturbingly, 80 percent of people said they were reusing their password. Now, this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down, because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers. So if you have to, write your passwords down, but dont reuse them. We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords. So CMU allows 32 possible symbols, but as you can see, theres only a small number that most people are using, so were not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords. So this was a really interesting study, and now we had data from 470 people, but in the scheme of things, thats really not very much password data, and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data. So it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords, and they often go and post these passwords on the Internet. So we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets. This is still not really ideal for research, though, because its not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from, or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords. So we wanted to find some better source of data. So we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study. So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk, and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute, a few minutes, an hour, and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars, to do a task for you, and then you pay them through Amazon dot com. So we paid people about 50 cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey, and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey. So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords, and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with. So some people had a pretty easy policy, we call it Basic8, and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters. Then some people had a much harder policy, and this was very similar to the CMU policy, that it had to have eight characters including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol, and pass a dictionary check. And one of the other policies we tried, and there were a whole bunch more, but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16, and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least 16 characters. All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords, and so we had much more detailed information. Again we see that theres only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords. We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating, but as you may recall, there isnt a good measure of password strength. So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using, or that we could find information about in the research literature. So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords, they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash, and so what theyll do is theyll make a guess as to what a password is, run it through a hashing function, and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list. So a dumb attacker will try every password in order. Theyll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB, and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have. A smart attacker, on the other hand, does something much more clever. They look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets, and they guess those first. So theyre going to start by guessing password, and then theyll guess I love you, and monkey, and 12345678, because these are the passwords that are most likely for people to have. In fact, some of you probably have these passwords. So what we found by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were, we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong, and the complex passwords were pretty strong too. However, when we looked at the survey data, we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords, and the long passwords were a lot more usable, and in some cases, they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords. So this suggests that, instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords, we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords. Now heres the problem, though. Some people had long passwords that actually werent very strong. You can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess. So we need to do more than just say long passwords. There has to be some additional requirements, and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type. Another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter. Here are some examples. You may have seen these on the Internet when you were creating passwords. We decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work. Do they actually help people have stronger passwords, and if so, which ones are better. So we tested password meters that were different sizes, shapes, colors, different words next to them, and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny. As you type a better password, the bunny dances faster and faster. So this was pretty fun. What we found was that password meters do work. Most of the password meters were actually effective, and the dancing bunny was very effective too, but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job, and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft. They tell you youre doing a good job too early, and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback, you probably would have better passwords. Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps, is to use pass phrases instead of passwords. So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago, and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases, and if you look at the second row of this cartoon, you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase correct horse battery staple would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember. He says, in fact, youve already remembered it. And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not. In fact, everybody who I talk to, who I mention Im doing password research, they point out this cartoon. Oh, have you seen it. That xkcd. Correct horse battery staple. So we did the research study to see what would actually happen. So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again, and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase. Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words. If we asked a human to do it, they would pick things that were not very random. So we tried a few different conditions. In one condition, the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the English language, and so youd get pass phrases like try there three come. And we looked at that, and we said, Well, that doesnt really seem very memorable. So then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech, so how about noun verb adjective noun. That comes up with something thats sort of sentence like. So you can get a pass phrase like plan builds sure power or end determines red drug. And these seemed a little bit more memorable, and maybe people would like those a little bit better. We wanted to compare them with passwords, and so we had the computer pick random passwords, and these were nice and short, but as you can see, they dont really look very memorable. And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password. So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable, like tufritvi and vadasabi. That one kind of rolls off your tongue. So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer. So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly, pass phrases were not actually all that good. People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords, and because the pass phrases are longer, they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in. So its not really a clear win for pass phrases. Sorry, all of you xkcd fans. On the other hand, we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well, and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better. So one of the problems with some of the studies that weve done is that because theyre all done using Mechanical Turk, these are not peoples real passwords. Theyre the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study. And we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords. So we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon and asked them if we could have everybodys real passwords. Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us, but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff, into a locked computer in a locked room, not connected to the Internet, and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords. They audited our code. They ran the code. And so we never actually saw anybodys password. We got some interesting results, and those of you Tepper students in the back will be very interested in this. So we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually 1.8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school. We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. The other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk generated passwords, there was actually a lot of similarities, and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually, collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords. So that was good news. Okay, I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school. One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts, and I made this quilt here. Its called Security Blanket. And this quilt has the 1,000 most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website. And the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset. And what I did is I created this word cloud, and I went through all 1,000 words, and I categorized them into loose thematic categories. And it was, in some cases, it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in, and then I color coded them. So here are some examples of the difficulty. So justin. Is that the name of the user, their boyfriend, their son. Maybe theyre a Justin Bieber fan. Or princess. Is that a nickname. Are they Disney princess fans. Or maybe thats the name of their cat. Iloveyou appears many times in many different languages. Theres a lot of love in these passwords. If you look carefully, youll see theres also some profanity, but it was really interesting to me to see that theres a lot more love than hate in these passwords. And there are animals, a lot of animals, and monkey is the most common animal and the 14th most popular password overall. And this was really curious to me, and I wondered, Why are monkeys so popular. And so in our last password study, any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word monkey in it, we asked them why they had a monkey in their password. And what we found out, we found 17 people so far, I think, who have the word monkey, We found out about a third of them said they have a pet named monkey or a friend whose nickname is monkey, and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute. And that guy is really cute. So it seems that at the end of the day, when we make passwords, we either make something thats really easy to type, a common pattern, or things that remind us of the word password or the account that weve created the password for, or whatever. Or we think about things that make us happy, and we create our password based on things that make us happy. And while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun, it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password. So I know a lot of these TED Talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice, happy things, but when youre creating your password, try to think about something else. Thank you. "
"What is going on in this babys mind. If youd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric, that he couldnt take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect. In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture. So in some ways, we think that this babys thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists. Let me give you just one example of this. One thing that this baby could be thinking about, that could be going on in his mind, is trying to figure out whats going on in the mind of that other baby. After all, one of the things thats hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling. And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isnt actually exactly like what we think and feel. Anyone whos followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get. We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people. Now the question is. How could we ask them. Babies, after all, cant talk, and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks, what youll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that. So how do we actually ask them the question. Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli. What we did, Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I, was actually to give the babies two bowls of food, one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers. Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and dont like the raw broccoli. But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl. And she would act as if she liked it or she didnt. So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didnt like the broccoli, just like a baby and any other sane person. But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, Mmmmm, broccoli. I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm. And then she would take a little bit of the crackers, and shed go, Eww, yuck, crackers. I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck. So shed act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted. We did this with 15 and 18 month old babies. And then she would simply put her hand out and say, Can you give me some. So the question is. What would the baby give her, what they liked or what she liked. And the remarkable thing was that 18 month old babies, just barely walking and talking, would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli. On the other hand, 15 month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli, like they couldnt figure this out. But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what they thought everybody must like. So there are two really remarkable things about this. The first one is that these little 18 month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature, that we dont always want the same thing. And whats more, they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted. Even more remarkably though, the fact that 15 month olds didnt do this suggests that these 18 month olds had learned this deep, profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old. So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought. And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years thats actually demonstrated it. The question you might ask though is. Why do children learn so much. And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time. I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless. And actually in many ways, theyre worse than useless, because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive. But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies, it turns out that theres actually an answer. If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that theres a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there. On one side is a New Caledonian crow. And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth, are incredibly smart birds. Theyre as smart as chimpanzees in some respects. And this is a bird on the cover of science whos learned how to use a tool to get food. On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken. And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps. So theyre very, very good at pecking for grain, and theyre not much good at doing anything else. Well it turns out that the babies, the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings. They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird. Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months. So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot. Theres something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning. Well what kind of explanation could we have for this. Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well. So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment. Other creatures, like the crows, arent very good at doing anything in particular, but theyre extremely good at learning about laws of different environments. And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows. We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal. Were smarter, were more flexible, we can learn more, we survive in more different environments, we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space. And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species. My son is 23. And at least until theyre 23, were still popping those worms into those little open mouths. All right, why would we see this correlation. Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage. And that one big disadvantage is that, until you actually do all that learning, youre going to be helpless. So you dont want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better. You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up. And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor. So the idea is that we have this early period when were completely protected. We dont have to do anything. All we have to do is learn. And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world. So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species. So theyre the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and were production and marketing. We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use. Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups, we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species, kind of like caterpillars and butterflies, except that theyre actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring, and were the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path. If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn, and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning, thats what theyre for, we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms. And in fact, the babys brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better. And theres been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently. And it all depends on the ideas of this guy, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century. And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize, describe, the way that scientists find out about the world. So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with. They go out and test it against the evidence. The evidence makes them change that hypothesis. Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth. And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that. And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now. And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing. So if you want to know whats going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually looks something like this. This is Reverend Bayess notebook. So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that theyre revising to figure out how the world works. All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate. Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics, they look extremely stupid. How could it be that children are doing statistics. So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector. This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world. Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student. If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector. But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way. Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldnt ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times. Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times. So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence. It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy. So we did just this, we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go. And sure enough, the four year olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector. Now there are two things that are really interesting about this. The first one is, again, remember, these are four year olds. Theyre just learning how to count. But unconsciously, theyre doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure. And the other interesting thing is that theyre using that evidence to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world, that seems very unlikely to begin with. And in studies weve just been doing in my lab, similar studies, weve show that four year olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world, but after all, scientists also do experiments, and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments. When children do experiments we call it getting into everything or else playing. And theres been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program. Heres one from Cristine Legares lab. What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors. And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didnt, and then she showed them an anomaly. And what youll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes. Boy. How about this. Same as the other side. Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. Boy. This one lighted up, and this one nothing. Okay, hes got his experimental notebook out. Boy. Whats making this light up. I dont know. Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. Boy. Oh, its because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this. Okay, hypothesis two. Boy. Thats why. Oh. Now this is his next idea. He told the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out onto the other location. Not working either. Boy. Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here. Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this doesnt have electricity. Okay, thats a fourth hypothesis. Boy. Its lighting up. So when you put four. So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up. Okay,theres his fifth hypothesis. Now that is a particularly, that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical. If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments. This is actually pretty typical of four year olds. Well, whats it like to be this kind of creature. Whats it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes. Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all. And I think just the opposite is true. I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults. Now heres what we know about how adult consciousness works. And adults attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight. So what happens for adults is we decide that somethings relevant or important, we should pay attention to it. Our consciousness of that thing that were attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark. And we even know something about the way the brain does this. So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible, more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains. So we have a very focused, purpose driven kind of attention. If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different. I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness. So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. But theyre very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once. And if you actually look in their brains, you see that theyre flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts havent come on yet. So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that theyre bad at not paying attention. So theyre bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing thats important. Thats the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness, that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn. Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where were put in a new situation that weve never been in before, when we fall in love with someone new, or when were in a new city for the first time. And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting attending zombie back home. And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee youve been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. So whats it like to be a baby. Its like being in love in Paris for the first time after youve had three double espressos. Thats a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three oclock in the morning. Now its good to be a grownup. I dont want to say too much about how wonderful babies are. Its good to be a grownup. We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves. And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do. But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open mindedness, open learning, imagination, creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children.

"A long time ago, I was a professional animator. And at night, I would make my own experimental films. And I was spending a lot of time, way too much time, in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen, and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again. Now, before The Simpsons, before Gumby, before Betty Boop, before there was such a thing as cinema and television, animation was hugely popular in this form. This is a zoetrope. And you spin this drum, and you look through the slits into the inside of the drum, and you see the animation pop to life. This is animation in physical form, and its animation I could get my hands on again. I took these ideas to Denmark. I went there with my family on a Fulbright Fellowship. Thats my daughter, Mia. I rode around the city on my bicycle and shot all the interesting moving elements of Copenhagen, the boaters in the canals, the colors that explode in spring, the free use city bikes, love, textures, the healthy cuisine, And I brought all that video back into the physical world by printing it out on these long strips of ink jet paper and cutting out the forms. Now, I invented my own form of the zoetrope, which removes the drum and replaces the slits with a video camera. And this was very exciting for me, because it meant that I could make these physical objects, and I could make films from those objects. Thats me riding on my bicycle. I made about 25 paper sculptures, each the size of a bicycle wheel. I brought them into the studio, spun them and shot them to make the film Copenhagen Cycles. This project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again but it helped me get my life back. Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day with my face plastered to a screen, I was having these little adventures with our new family and shooting video along the way, and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life. And I think that its no mistake that zoetrope translates into wheel of life. But film and video does flatten sculpture, so I tried to imagine a way that animated sculpture could be experienced as such, and also a completely immersive kind of animated sculpture. And thats where I came up with the idea for the zoetrope tunnel. You walk through with a handheld strobe, and wherever you point the flashlight, the animation pops to life. I plan to finish this project in the next 30 to 40 years. But I did build a half scale prototype. Its covered in Velcro, and I could lay inside on this bridge and stick animated sequences to the walls and test stuff out. People would comment that it reminded them of an MRI. And that medical connection spoke to me, because at the age of 14, I was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition thats slowly taking my vision away, and Id never responded to that in my work. So I responded to it in this piece called, Implant. It is an imaginary, super magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve. And the public is, in a sense, miniaturized to experience it. With a handheld strobe, they can explore the sculpture, and discover thousands of cell sized robots hard at work, leaping in and out of the optic nerve, being deployed to the retina to repair it. Its my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder. Now, in the real world gene therapy and gene therapy research, healthy genes are being administered to unhealthy cells using viruses. Theres a lot of colorful, fluffy hope in this, and theres also some creepy, threatening idea of viruses maybe becoming an invasive species in your body. Vision loss has helped to take me away from the things that disconnect me from the world. Instead of being sealed off in an automobile, I ride my bike, take buses and trains and walk a lot. And instead of a visually intensive process in the studio, primarily, Im also getting outdoors a lot more and using more of my senses. This landscape is a couple hours east of San Diego, California. My brother lives out that way. He and I went camping there for four days. And I grabbed my camera, and I walked through the canyons. And I tried to imagine and figure out what kind of motion would be present in this place that was so still and so devoid of motion. I think its the stillest place Ive ever been. And I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the animation. It was the motion of changing perspective. So I created this piece called Mud Caves from those photographs. Its a multilayered print piece, and you can think of it as a zoetrope laid flat. Its kind of my western landscape panorama. And next to the print piece theres a video monitor that shows the animation hidden within the artwork. I think one of the best parts about this project for me was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot, who lives 2,500 miles away from me. And we would just sit in this seemingly eternal landscape sculpted by water over millions of years and talk. Wed talk about our kids growing up and the slowing pace of our parents, and our dad whos suffering from leukemia, memory loss and infection. And it struck me that, as individuals, were finite, but as a family, we are an ongoing cycle, a kind of wheel of life. Now, I want to leave you with a tribute to one of my mentors. She reminds me that physical presence is important and that play is not a luxury, but a necessity. Shes Pixie, and shes our family dog. And she loves to jump. And this is a new kind of zoetrope that I developed at the Imaging Research Center at UMBC in Baltimore. And I call it a real time zoetrope. Thank you. "
"Probably not a surprise to you, but I dont like to be in a hospital or go to a hospital. Do you. Im sure many of you feel the same way, right. But why. Why is it that we hate hospitals so much. Or is it just a fact of life we have to live with. Is it the crappy food. Is it the expensive parking. Is it the intense smell. Or is it the fear of the unknown. Well, its all of that, and its more. Patients often have to travel long distances to get to their nearest hospital, and access to hospital care is becoming more and more an issue in rural areas, in the US, but also in sparsely populated countries like Sweden. And even when hospitals are more abundant, typically the poor and the elderly have trouble getting care because they lack transportation that is convenient and affordable to them. And many people are avoiding hospital care altogether, and they miss getting proper treatment due to cost. We see that 64 percent of Americans are avoiding care due to cost. And even when you do get treatment, hospitals often make us sicker. Medical errors are reported to be the third cause of death in the US, just behind cancer and heart disease, the third cause of death. Im in health care for over 20 years now, and I witness every day how broken and how obsolete our hospital system is. Let me give you two examples. Four in 10 Japanese medical doctors and five in 10 American medical doctors are burnt out. In my home country, the Netherlands, only 17 million people live there. We are short 125,000 nurses over the coming years. But how did we even end up here, in this idea of placing all kinds of sick people together in one big building. Well, we have to go back to the Ancient Greeks. In 400 BC, temples for cure were erected where people could go to get their diagnosis, their treatment and their healing. And then really for about 2,000 years, weve seen religious care centers all the way up to the Industrial Revolution, where weve seen hospitals being set up as assembly lines based on the principles of the Industrial Revolution, to produce efficiently and get the products, the patients in this case, out of the hospital as soon as possible. Over the last century, weve seen lots of interesting innovations. We figured out how to make insulin. We invented pacemakers and X ray, and we even came into this wonderful new era of cell and gene therapies. But the biggest change to fix our hospital system altogether is still ahead of us. And I believe its time now, we have the opportunity, to revolutionize the system altogether and forget about our current hospital system. I believe its time to create a new system that revolves around health care at home. Recent research has shown that 46 percent of hospital care can move to the patients home. Thats a lot. And thats mainly for those patients who suffer from chronic diseases. With that, hospitals can and should reduce to smaller, agile and mobile care centers focused on acute care. So things like neonatology, intensive care, surgery and imaging will still remain at the hospitals, at least I believe for the foreseeable future. A few weeks ago, I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer, and she said, Niels, its hard. Its so hard when we know that shes got only months to live. Instead of playing with the grandchildren, she now has to travel three times a week two hours up and down to Amsterdam just to get her treatment and tests. And that really breaks my heart, because we all know that a professional nurse could draw her blood at home as well, right. And if she could get her tests and treatment at home as well, she could do the things that are really important to her in her last months. My own mom, 82 years old now, God bless her, shes avoiding to go to the hospital because she finds it difficult to plan and manage the journey. So my sisters and I, we help her out. But theres many elderly people who are avoiding care and are waiting that long that it becomes life threatening, and its straight to the costly, intensive care. Dr. Covinsky, a clinical researcher at the University of California, he concludes that a third of patients over 70 and more than half of patients over 85, leave the hospital more disabled than when they came in. And a very practical problem that many patients face when they have to go to a hospital is. Where do I go with my main companion in life, where do I go with my dog. Thats our dog, by the way. Isnt she cute. But its not only about convenience. Its also about unnecessary health care stays and costs. A friend of mine, Art, he recently needed to be hospitalized for just a minor surgery, and he had to stay in the hospital for over two weeks, just because he needed a specific kind of IV antibiotics. So he occupied a bed for two weeks that cost over a thousand euros a day. Its just ridiculous. And these costs are really at the heart of the issue. So weve seen over many of our global economies, health care expense grow as a percentage of GDP over the last years. So here we see that over the last 50 years, health care expense has grown from about five percent in Germany to about 11 percent now. In the US, weve seen growth from six percent to over 17 percent now. And a large portion of these costs are driven by investments in large, shiny hospital buildings. And these buildings are not flexible, and they maintain a system where hospital beds need to be filled for a hospital to run efficiently. Theres no incentive for a hospital to run with less beds. Just the thought of that makes you sick, right. And heres the thing, the cost for treating my buddy Art at home can be up to 10 times cheaper than hospital care. And that is where were headed. The hospital bed of the future will be in our own homes. And its already starting. Global home care is growing 10 percent year over year. And from my own experience, I see that logistics and technology are making these home health care solutions work. Technology is already allowing us to do things that were once exclusive to hospitals. Diagnosis tests like blood, glucose tests, urine tests, can now be taken in the comfort of our homes. And more and more connected devices we see like pacemakers and insulin pumps that will proactively signal if help is needed soon. And all that technology is coming together in much more insights into the patients health, and that insight and all of the information leads to better control and to less medical errors, remember, the third cause of death in the US. And I see it every day at work. I work in logistics and for me, home health care works. So we see a delivery driver deliver the medicine to the patients home. A nurse joins him and actually administers the drug at the patients home. Its that simple. Remember my buddy, Art. He can now get the IV antibiotics in the comfort of his home, no hospital pajamas, no crappy food and no risk of these antibiotic resistant superbugs that only bite you in these hospitals. And it goes further. So now the elderly people can get the treatment that they need in the comfort of their own home while with their best companion in life. And theres no need anymore to drive hours and hours just to get your treatment and tests. In the Netherlands and in Denmark, weve seen very good successes in cancer clinics organizing chemotherapies at the patients homes, sometimes even together with fellow patients. The best improvements for these patients have been improvements in reduction in stress, anxiety disorders and depression. Home health care also helped them to get back a sense of normality and freedom in their lives, and theyve actually helped them to forget about their disease. But home health care, Niels, what if I dont even have a home, when Im homeless, or when I do have a home but theres no one to take care of me or even open up the door. Well, in comes our sharing economy, or, as I like to call it, the Airbnb for home care. In the Netherlands, we see churches and care organizations match people in need of care and company with people who actually have a home for them and can provide care and company to them. Home health care is cheaper, its easier to facilitate, and its quick to set up, in these rural areas we talked about, but also in humanitarian crisis situations where its often safer, quicker and cheaper to set things up at home. Home health care is very applicable in prosperous areas but also very much in underserved communities. Home health care works in developed countries as well as in developing countries. So Im passionate to help facilitate improvements in patients lives due to home health care. Im passionate to help facilitate that the elderly people get the treatment that they need in the comfort of their own homes, together with their best companion in life. Im passionate to make the change and help ensure that patients, and not their disease, are in control of their lives. To me, that is health care delivered at home. Thank you. "
"Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet. But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree, which produced this painting, moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines. I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic. And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons. Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women. That number is rising. Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison. Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes. In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. That, I think, is movement. We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That, I think, is movement. We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs, the Oregon spotted frog, for later release into protected wetlands. That, I think, is movement. And just recently, weve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. Theyve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. Theyre kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, theyre placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day theyre brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we cant bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and hes providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence. And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change. Thank you very much. "
"Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid century, this will increase to 70 percent. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future. In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi permanent villages for the first time in history. Why only semi permanent. you might ask. Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people could rely on a steady and long term supply of food, making permanent settlements possible. And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts, ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few sources of clean water that existed then. And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didnt really get their start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution. So, what is the future of cities. Global population is currently more than 7 billion and is predicted to top out around 10 billion. Most of this growth will occur in the urban areas of the worlds poorest countries. So, how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth. First, the world will need to seek ways to provide adequate food, sanitation, and education for all people. Second, growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population. Food production might move to vertical farms and skyscrapers, rooftop gardens, or vacant lots in city centers, while power will increasingly come from multiple sources of renewable energy. Instead of single family homes, more residences will be built vertically. We may see buildings that contain everything that people need for their daily life, as well as a smaller, self sufficient cities focused on local and sustainable production. The future of cities is diverse, malleable, and creative, no longer built around a single industry, but reflecting an increasingly connected and global world."
"So how would you run a whole country without oil. Thats the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago. It never left my brain. And I started playing with it more like a puzzle. The original thought I had, this must be ethanol. So I went out and researched ethanol, and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country. About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen, until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth, which is, you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car, if you use hydrogen. So that is not going to be the path to go. And then sort of through a process of wandering around, I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars, in a way that is convenient and affordable, you could get to a solution. Now I started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse. Not how do you build one car, but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99 percent of the population. The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today. So one, it has to be more convenient than a car. And two, it has be more affordable than todays cars. Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right. Alright. Thats not something that we can finance or buy today. And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight. So were bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics. And so the thought that I started with was how do you do this, still within the boundary of the science we know today, no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up. How do you do it within the economics that we have today. How do you do it from the power of the consumer up. And not from the power of an edict down. On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon, I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership. In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included. Now if you separate between the two, you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network, by creating a network before the cars show up. The network has two components in them. First component is you charge the car whenever you stop, ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours. If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute. And so the first thought that came to mind is, everywhere we park we have electric power. Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world, like Scandinavia, you already have that. If you park your car and didnt plug in the heater, when you come back you dont have a car. It just doesnt work. Now that last mile, last foot, in a sense, is the first step of the infrastructure. The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension. See were bound by todays technology on batteries, which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations. 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. But you never want to get stuck. So what we added is a second element to our network, which is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on. You dont do it as a human being. You do it as a machine. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and within two minutes youre back on the road and you can go again. If you had charge spots everywhere, and you had battery swap stations everywhere, how often would you do it. And it ends up that youd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. As a matter of fact, we added to the contract. We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because its an inconvenience. Then we looked at the question of the affordability. We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car. What is the cost of that battery. Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive. What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons, something interesting happens. We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again. The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense. Remember in your car you have a gas tank. You have the crude oil. And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline. The battery in this sense, is the crude oil. We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank. But the crude oil is replaced with a battery. Just it doesnt burn. It consumes itself step after step after step. It has 2,000 life cycles these days. And so its sort of a mini well. We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car. Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car. In a sense what weve done is weve created a new consumable. You, today, buy gasoline miles. And we created electric miles. And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number. Today 2010, in volume, when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile. Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means, in the average consumer environment were in in the U.S. 20 miles per gallon thats a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon. Thats cheaper than todays gasoline, even in the U.S. In Europe where taxes are in place, thats the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel. But e miles follow Moores Law. They go from eight cents a mile in 2010, to four cents a mile in 2015, to two cents a mile by 2020. Why. Because batteries life cycle improve, a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price. And these prices are actually with clean electrons. We do not use any electrons that come from coal. So in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon, zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020. Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020, which is our desire. Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road. That is an 80 cent gallon. An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil, and wed let any oil company bring it out and refine it, they still cant compete with two cents a mile. Thats a new economic factor, which is fascinating to most people. Now this would have been a wonderful paper. Thats how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments. And some governments told me that its fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things. Until I got to the true young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel, and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me. First he let me go to the prime minister of the country, who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network, 200 million dollars, and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume, in two million cars, thats what we needed in Israel, Ill give you country to invest the 200 million into. Peres thought that was a great idea. So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies. We sent letters to all the car companies. Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount. But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan, when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating. He said hybrids are like mermaids. When you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish. And Ghosn came up and said, I have the car, Mr. Peres. I will build you the cars. And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume, mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars. Its the first mass volume electric car, zero emission electric car in the market. I was running, as Chris said, to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP And then Peres said, Well wont you run this project. And I said, Im ready for CEO And he said, Oh no no no no no. Youve got to explain to me, what is more important than saving your country and saving the world, that you would go and do. And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place. We then decided to scale it up. We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark. And Denmark set this beautiful policy, its called the IQ test. Its inversely proportional to taxes. They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars. So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros. If you buy our car its about 20,000 Euros. If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country. We then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands. I know most people dont think of Israel as a small island, but Israel is an island, its a transportation island. If your car is driving outside Israel its been stolen. If youre thinking about it in terms of islands, we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find, and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia. Its got three centers, in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney, and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them. The next island was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii. We decided to come into the U.S. and pick the two best places, the one where you didnt need any range extension. Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery. And if you really have a long day you can switch, and keep on driving around the island. The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors. He decided that hes going to take over the state, unofficially, and then officially, and then created this beautiful Region One policy. In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses, but you also have the perfect range extender. Its called the other car. As we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.. Why is this a big issue. And the most fascinating thing weve learned is that, when you have small problems on the individual level, like the price of gasoline to drive every morning. You dont notice it, but when the aggregate comes up youre dead. Alright. So the price of oil, much like lots of other curves that weve seen, goes along a depletion curve. The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground. It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out. You think, well its been up, its been down, its been up, its going to keep on going up and down. Here is the problem, at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago, the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil. Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47, sometimes its 40, sometimes its 50. Now were running a stimulus package. Its called the trillion dollar stimulus package. Were going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015, somewhere in that space. What happens when the economy recovers. By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now. Thats another 30 percent demand on oil. That is another 25 million barrels a day. Thats all the U.S. usage today. In other words at some point when weve recovered we go up to the peak. And then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel. We take our money and we give it away. You know what happens at that point. We go back down. Its going to go up and down. And the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter. And thats the difference between problems that are additive, like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip, and problems that are depletive, in which we lose what we have, which oscillate, and they oscillate until we lose everything weve got. Now we actually looked at what the answer would be. Right. Remember in the campaign, one million hybrid cars by 2015. That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption. That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world. That wont do much difference. We looked at an MIT study, ten million electric cars on the global roads. Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then. That is the most pessimistic number you can have. Its also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from 100 thousand cars is 2011, to 10 million cars by 2016, 100 x growth in less than five years. You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars. We have 10 million cars by region. Thats an enormous amount of cars. China is adding those cars, India, Russia, Brazil. We have all these regions. Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline. Theyll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high. China solves it by an edict. At some point theyll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it. The Indians dont even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time. For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range, not a reduction in range. Were the only ones who dont have the price set right. We dont have the industry set right. We dont have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S. Now where is the car industry on that. Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves. They basically looked at it and said, Car 1.0 well solve everything within the car itself. No infrastructure, no problem. We forgot about the entire chain around us. All this stuff that happens around. We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0, a whole new market, a whole new business model. The business model in which the money that is actually coming in, to drive the car, the minutes, the miles if you want, that you are all familiar with, subsidize the price of the car, just like cellphones. Youll pay for the miles. And some of it will go back to the car maker. Some of it will go back to your own pocket. But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. Youre looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills. In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills, not from oil. In Israel, weve asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel. And people said, Oh thats a very very large space that youre asking for. And we said, What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years. And they said, We tried. There isnt any. We said, No no, but what if we prove it. And they said, Well you can dig. And we decided to dig up, instead of digging down. These are perfect matches to one another. Now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated. Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years. Thats one percent a year. Now when were looking at solving big problems, we need to start thinking in two numbers. And those are not 20 percent by 2020. The two numbers are zero, as in zero footprint or zero oil, and scale it infinity. And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year we cant stop thinking of padding CO2. We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale. One car emits four tons. And actually 700 and change million cars today emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2. Thats, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem. Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the worlds CO2 emissions. We have to come and attack this problem with a focus, with an effort that actually says, were going to go to zero before the world ends. I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S. I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols. I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said were going to send a man to the moon, and well do it by the end of the decade. We didnt say were going to send a man 20 percent to the moon. And there will be about a 20 percent chance well recover him. He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago. 200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain, there was a long argument over economy versus morality. 25 percent, just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars, 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. came from a source of energy that was immoral, human slaves. And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves. And what would it do to our economy. And people said, Well we need to take time to do it. Lets not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves. And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery, and the industrial revolution started within less than one year. And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth. We have to make the right moral decision. We have to make it immediately. We need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil. And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years, but within this presidential term because if we dont, we will lose our economy, right after wed lost our morality. Thank you all very much. "
"According to the UN, billions of people still live without an address. The economist Hernando de Soto said, Without an address, you live outside the law. You might as well not exist. Im here to tell you how my team and I are trying to change that. If you go to an online map and look at a favela in Brazil or a township in South Africa, youll see a few streets but a lot of empty space. But if you flip to satellite view, there are thousands of people, homes and businesses in this vast, unmapped and unaddressed spaces. In Ghanas capital, Accra, there are numbers and letters scrawled onto the sides of walls, where they piloted address systems but not finished them. But these places, these unaddressed places, hold huge economic potential. Heres why the issue of addressing stuck with me. I worked in the music business for 10 years, and what you may not know about the music world is that every day, people struggle with the problems of addressing. So from the musicians who have to find the gigs to the production companies who bring the equipment, everyone somehow always gets lost. We even had to add someone to our schedules who was the person you called when you thought youd arrived but then realized you hadnt. And we had some pretty bad days, like in Italy, where a truck driver unloaded all the equipment an hour north of Rome, not an hour south of Rome, and a slightly worse day where a keyboard player called me and said, Chris, dont panic, but we may have just sound checked at the wrong peoples wedding. So not long after the fated Rome event, I chatted this through with a friend of mine who is a mathematician, and we thought it was a problem we could do something about. We thought, well, we could make a new system, but it shouldnt look like the old system. We agreed that addresses were bad. We knew we wanted something very precise, but GPS coordinates, latitude and longitude, were just too complicated. So we divided the world into three meter squares. The world divides into around 57 trillion three meter squares, and we found that there are enough combinations of three dictionary words that we could name every three meter square in the world uniquely with just three words. We used 40,000 words, so thats 40,000 cubed, 64 trillion combinations of three words, which is more than enough for the 57 trillion odd three meter squares, with a few spare. So thats exactly what we did. We divided the world into three meter squares, gave each one a unique, three word identifier, what we call a three word address. So for example, right here, Im standing at mustards.coupons.pinup, but over here ... Im standing at pinched. singularly.tutorial. But we havent just done this in English. We thought it was essential that people should be able to use this system in their own language. So far, weve built it into 14 languages, including French, Swahili and Arabic, and were working on more now, like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi. But this idea can do a lot more than just get my musicians to their gigs on time. If the 75 percent of countries that struggle with reliable addressing started using three word addresses, theres a stack of far more important applications. In Durban, South Africa, an NGO called Gateway Health have distributed 11,000 three word address signs to their community, so the pregnant mothers, when they go into labor, can call the emergency services and tell them exactly where to pick them up from, because otherwise, the ambulances have often taken hours to find them. In Mongolia, the National Post Service have adopted the system and are now doing deliveries to many peoples houses for the first time. The UN are using it to geotag photos in disaster zones so they can deliver aid to exactly the right place. Even Dominos Pizza are using it in the Caribbean, because they havent been able to find customers homes, but they really want to get their pizza to them while its still hot. Shortly, youll be able to get into a car, speak the three words, and the car will navigate you to that exact spot. In Africa, the continent has leapfrogged phone lines to go to mobile phones, bypassed traditional banks to go straight to mobile payments. Were really proud that the post services of three African countries, Nigeria, Djibouti and Cote dIvoire, have gone straight to adopting three word addresses, which means that people in those countries have a really simple way to explain where they live, today. For me, poor addressing was an annoying frustration, but for billions of people, its a huge business inefficiency, severely hampers their infrastructure growth, and can cost lives. Were on a mission to change that, three words at a time. Thank you. "
"You know, one of the things that Id like to say upfront is that Im really here by accident. And what I mean, not at TED, that Im, at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. But what Id like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident, technology played a big role in that. So, what Id like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because Id like to put in context what Im going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education. And once I put that in context, Id like to tell you a little bit about technology, why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler, a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned, that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50 times 15. And then Ill come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more, hopefully convince you, that I believe that in todays world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you, Im one of five children. Im the oldest, the other four are women. So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this. I was born in a very small village in Mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education. But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters. That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. My parents were fanatics about learning, and Ill come back to that a little bit later. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen, is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard, and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow, to this day, I frankly dont know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world, but, by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old, and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever, and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites, was a real exposure to me to classical music. He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world. And would tell me a little bit about history too, when hed play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music, in some way, represented a little bit of that history. And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech, but if you can imagine the time when this occurred, it was in the mid 40s, this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech. Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that, people ask me and say, Well, how did your parents treat you when you were a child. And I always said that they were really tough on me. And not tough in the sense that most people think of, where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever. They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up, both my mother and father would always say to me, its really important that you always remember two things. First of all, when you go to bed at night, youve got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something, and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could. And the second thing they said, and we trust you, that no matter where you are or where you go, you will always do the right thing. Now, I dont know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, its the most pressure you can put on a child, to say, , we trust you that you will always do the right thing. When I was out with my friends drinking beer, I always was very aware of those words, , and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if its accessible, and it can only be helpful if its affordable. And in todays world, being useful, affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today. So, one of our passions in our company, and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable. And to me, that is very, very critical. Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days. You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers. A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. Although frankly speaking, we dont believe the Internet is the killer app. What we believe is that the Internet, frankly, is a connection of people and ideas. The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome. And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred, that were faced today with a tremendous opportunity. If we can connect people and ideas more intensely, and although youve seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today, the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way, accessibility, in an easy manner, and also affordability, that regardless of the economic status that a person could have, that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology. So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50 times 15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldnt do it by ourselves, and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone. We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments, industry, educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors. So, it is really a rather lofty initiative, if you want to think that way, but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead, that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. And Ill come back to that in a minute, because I think the results so far have been remarkable, and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, while we get to the 2015 initiative. Where are we today. Thats year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder dot com. Those of you whove never looked at their website, you should look at it. Its really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015, the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. One is the Western world, defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States, has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase. As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable, even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries, such as India and China, the progress has been good, has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed, places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact, I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki, and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it thats keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster. And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost, to be able to enable the connectivity that were all trying to reach. So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down. So, when you look at this chart, you look at the very last, its a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale, you look at the very end, weve got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent. But were excited in our company, were motivated. We really think its a phenomenal driver of things, to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually, working with so many partners around the world, to be able to reach that goal. Now, one of the things Id like to explain about 50 times 15, which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity. It is actually a business venture. Lets take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world, and call it the education market. When you look at elementary school children, we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet. Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment. And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly, this is not a charity. This is really a business venture, one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market. Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether its education or under developed nations, either way, its a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and Ill explain that in just a minute. It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human centric solutions. What we mean by that is, you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking more or less, and for 20 odd years, it hasnt changed. It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same. And frankly, and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this, but I truly mean it, if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it, it would be very difficult to judge who made it, because theyre all highly commoditized but theyre all different. So, there has not been a human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market, so we really believe it is critical to think of it. It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. Were talking about something very similar here. And it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology. In other parts, it doesnt. In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. In other parts, it doesnt. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece, which is really important, and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one, is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end to end ecosystems. What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore Im a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. Its a country of 45 million people. Its an economy thats emerging. Its beginning to grow tremendously. They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. Theyre developing a software training environment in their universities. What a place, what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two, English and Afrikaans, but it turns out they have 18 dialects. And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system, it could only be done from inside. I dont think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world, and just dumping product and selling into the markets. So, we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large, and theres an infrastructure that can provide it, that a local, integrated, end to end system is really critical for its success. This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in Mexico, in my home country. This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan. Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico, Michoacan is a very colorful state. Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes, and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids, in a computer. And I have to tell you that its so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids. We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa, in a school thats called Nelson Mandela School, and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers, its just phenomenal. And recently, theyve written us letters, telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams, on their capabilities, and its just phenomenal. We have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries, and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. And I have to tell you that although millions doesnt sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected, its a start. And we are learning a lot. And were learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective. One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. Some of you are familiar with this. This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies, Google is involved, Red Hat, and AMD is a key player. The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology, its a microprocessor. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10 hour battery life. Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours, and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it. The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part, and battery life on this product is now 15 hours, just through a lot of innovative work people have done because theyre passionate and motivated to be able to do this. We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year, and were very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. Its a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. We also have partnered with TED in this project, with Architecture for Humanity, and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair, were having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region. And were really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this, and cant wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity. Let me come back to the beginning, to end this presentation. Ill tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business, is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I dont think its enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet, and look at numbers and say, yes, thats a good business. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents, and Ill give you a little anecdote, especially from my father. And it took me a while to understand it, but he said to me, when I went to college, he said, Youre the first person in the family to go to college. And its really important you understand that for civilization to make progress, each generation has to do better than the last one. And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation. Frankly, I dont know that I really understood what he told me at the time. I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study, and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love. I graduated. I decided to get married. And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, You know, Im going to remind you again, that each generation has to do better than the last one. You have to be a better husband than I was, because thats how you make progress. And now he began to make sense. Because I knew what a great husband he was, and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me, like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and were looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, Ive got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, youre going to have to be a better father than I was. Thats when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me, because he was a great father. But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Its got to be that someday I can look back, and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. Thank you very much. "
"So magic is a very introverted field. While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets. Thats true even amongst peers. But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R and D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research. Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic. And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open source software community to create new digital tools for magic, tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster. Today, Id like to show you something which came out of these collaborations. Its an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system, or a digital storytelling tool. Could we bring down the lights please. Thank you. So lets give this a try. And Im going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life. Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor. Wake up. Hey. Come on. Please. Come on. Ah, sorry about that. Forgot this. Give it another try. Okay. He figured out the system. Uh oh. All right. Lets try this. Come on. Hey. You heard her, go ahead. Bye bye. "
"Theres this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says, Dont hate the media. Be the media. Im an artist. I like working with media and technology because A, Im familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B, I hate them and Im terrified of the power they hold. I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, Well, were hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why. And Rumsfelds answer is, Well, we dont do body counts on other people. Right. Its estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians, have died as a result of the US led invasion in 2003. That number is in stark contrast with the 4,486 US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion. Monuments to war, such as Maya Lins Vietnam Memorial, are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one sided. I wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate. I remember when I was a boy in school, my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And we were told, if we wrote a really good letter, if we really thought about it, we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply. This is my Notepad. What looks like an everyday, yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion. Notepad is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the paper, when magnified, are revealed to be micro printed text that contains the details, the names, the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died. So, for the last 5 years, Ive been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff, and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments. I dont have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that. But also, Ive been meeting one on one with members and former members of the so called Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion. And so, whenever I can, I meet with one of them, and I share the project with them. And last summer, I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales. May I give this to you. This is a special legal tablet. Its actually part of an ongoing art project. This is a special legal pad. Yes. You wont believe me, but its in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Im an artist. And all of the lines of the paper are actually, Are they going to disappear. No, theyre micro printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq. Yeah. OK. Thank you. Thank you. The way he says thank you really creeps me out. OK, so Id like each of you to look under your chairs. Theres an envelope. And please open it. The paper youre holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion. Id like you to use this paper and write a member of government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives. Because every letter thats sent in to the government, and this is all across the world, of course, every letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded. Together, we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything thats sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government, our shared historical record. Thank you. So, tell me Matt, how did this idea come into your head, of Notepad. Id just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the Improvised Empathetic Device which accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data, it would stab me in the arm. And so, I became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas, but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties. Thank you so much. Thank you. "
"A shabby man named Estragon, sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot. Hes soon joined by his friend Vladimir, who reminds his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot. So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come, why theyre waiting, and whether theyre even at the right tree. From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger, but its considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question, what should the characters do. Estragon. Dont lets do anything. Its safer. Vladimir. Lets wait and see what he says. Estragon. Who. Vladimir. Godot. Estragon. Good idea. Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key features of the Theatre of the Absurd, a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artists struggling to find meaning in devastation. The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage. While this may sound grim, the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor. This is reflected in Becketts unique approach to genre in Waiting for Godot, which he branded a tragicomedy in two acts. Tragically, the characters are locked in an existential conundrum, they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose, but their only sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting, While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide. But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament, which comes across in their language and movements. Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay, repetition and double entendres, as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing, and frantically swapping their hats. Its often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry, or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two. Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. While Beckett had a lifelong love of language, he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps, pauses and moments of emptiness into his work. This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor, which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd. He also cultivated a mysterious persona, and refused to confirm or deny any speculations about the meaning of his work. This kept audiences guessing, increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds and enigmatic characters. The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation. Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirrors the plot of the drama itself. Its been read as an allegory of the Cold War, the French Resistance, and Britains colonization of Ireland. The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate. Theyve been read as survivors of the apocalypse, an aging couple, two impotent friends, and even as personifications of Freuds ego and id. Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon were wearing bowler hats. Like the critical speculation and maddening plot, their language often goes in circles as the two bicker and banter, lose their train of thought, and pick up right where they left off. Vladimir. We could start all over again perhaps Estragon. That should be easy Vladimir. Its the start thats difficult Estragon. You can start from anything Vladimir. Yes, but you have to decide. Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives, the world onstage doesnt always make sense. It can explore both reality and illusion, the familiar and the strange. And although a tidy narrative still appeals, the best theatre keeps us thinking and waiting."
"There are two powerful phenomena unfolding on earth, the rise of global warming and the rise of women and girls. The link between them is often overlooked, but gender equity is a key answer to our planetary challenge. Let me explain. For the last few years, I have been working on an effort called Project Drawdown. Our team has scoured humanitys wisdom for solutions to draw down heat trapping, climate changing emissions in the atmosphere, not someday, maybe, if were lucky solutions, the 80 best practices and technologies already in hand, clean, renewable energy, including solar and wind, green buildings, both new and retrofitted, efficient transportation from Brazil to China, thriving ecosystems through protection and restoration, reducing waste and reclaiming its value, growing food in good ways that regenerates soil, shifting diets to less meat, more plants, and equity for women and girls. Gender and climate are inextricably linked. Drawing down emissions depends on rising up. First, a bit of context. We are in a situation of urgency, severity and scope never before faced by humankind. So far, our response isnt anywhere close to adequate. But you already know that. You know it in your gut, in your bones. We are each part of the planets living systems, knitted together with almost 7.7 billion human beings and 1.8 million known species. We can feel the connections between us. We can feel the brokenness and the closing window to heal it. This earth, our home, is telling us that a better way of being must emerge, and fast. In my experience, to have eyes wide open is to hold a broken heart every day. Its a grief that I rarely speak, though my work calls on the power of voice. I remind myself that the heart can simply break, or it can break open. A broken open heart is awake and alive and calls for action. It is regenerative, like nature, reclaiming ruined ground, growing anew. Life moves inexorably toward more life, toward healing, toward wholeness. Thats a fundamental ecological truth. And we, all of us, we are life force. On the face of it, the primary link between women, girls and a warming world is not life but death. Awareness is growing that climate impacts hit women and girls hardest, given existing vulnerabilities. There is greater risk of displacement, higher odds of being injured or killed during a natural disaster. Prolonged drought can precipitate early marriage as families contend with scarcity. Floods can force last resort prostitution as women struggle to make ends meet. The list goes on and goes wide. These dynamics are most acute under conditions of poverty, from New Orleans to Nairobi. Too often, the story ends here. But not today. Another empowering truth begs to be seen. If we gain ground on gender equity, we also gain ground on addressing global warming. This connection comes to light in three key areas, three areas where we can secure the rights of women and girls, shore up resilience and avert emissions at the same time. Women are the primary farmers of the world. They produce 60 to 80 percent of food in lower income countries, often operating on fewer than five acres. Thats what the term smallholder means. Compared with men, women smallholders have less access to resources, including land rights, credit and capital, training, tools and technology. They farm as capably and efficiently as men, but this well documented disparity in resources and rights means women produce less food on the same amount of land. Close those gaps, and farm yields rise by 20 to 30 percent. That means 20 to 30 percent more food from the same garden or the same field. The implications for hunger, for health, for household income, theyre obvious. Lets follow the thread to climate. We humans need land to grow food. Unfortunately, forests are often cleared to supply it, and that causes emissions from deforestation. But if existing farms produce enough food, forests are less likely to be lost. So theres a ripple effect. Support women smallholders, realize higher yields, avoid deforestation and sustain the life giving power of forests. Project Drawdown estimates that addressing inequity in agriculture could prevent two billion tons of emissions between now and 2050. Thats on par with the impact household recycling can have globally. Addressing this inequity can also help women cope with the challenges of growing food as the climate changes. There is life force in cultivation. At last count, 130 million girls are still denied their basic right to attend school. Gaps are greatest in secondary school classrooms. Too many girls are missing a vital foundation for life. Education means better health for women and their children, better financial security, greater agency at home and in society, more capacity to navigate a climate changing world. Education can mean options, adaptability, strength. It can also mean lower emissions. For a variety of reasons, when we have more years of education, we typically choose to marry later and to have fewer children. So our families end up being smaller. What happens at the individual level adds up across the world and over time. One by one by one, the right to go to school impacts how many human beings live on this planet and impacts its living systems. Thats not why girls should be educated. Its one meaningful outcome. Education is one side of a coin. The other is family planning, access to high quality, voluntary reproductive health care. To have children by choice rather than chance is a matter of autonomy and dignity. Yet in the US, 45 percent of pregnancies are unintended. Two hundred and fourteen million women in lower income countries say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant but arent using contraception. Listening to womens needs, addressing those needs, advancing equity and well being, those must be the aims of family planning, period. Curbing the growth of our human population is a side effect, though a potent one. It could dramatically reduce demand for food, transportation, electricity, buildings, goods and all the rest, thereby reducing emissions. Close the gaps on access to education and family planning, and by mid century, we may find one billion fewer people inhabiting earth than we would if we do nothing more. According to Project Drawdown, one billion fewer people could mean we avoid nearly 120 billion tons of emissions. At that level of impact, gender equity is a top solution to restore a climate fit for life. At that level of impact, gender equity is on par with wind turbines and solar panels and forests. There is life force in learning and life force in choice. Now, let me be clear, this does not mean women and girls are responsible for fixing everything. Though we probably will. Equity for women in agriculture, education and family planning, these are solutions within a system of drawdown solutions. Together, they comprise a blueprint of possibility. And let me be even clearer about this, population cannot be seen in isolation from production or consumption. Some segments of the human family cause exponentially greater harm, while others suffer outsized injustice. The most affluent, we are the most accountable. We have the most to do. The gender climate connection extends beyond negative impacts and beyond powerful solutions. Women are vital voices and agents for change on this planet, and yet were too often missing or even barred from the proverbial table. Were too often ignored or silenced when we speak. We are too often passed over when plans are laid or investments made. According to one analysis, just 0.2 percent of philanthropic funds go specifically towards women and the environment, merely 110 million dollars globally, the sum spent by one man on a single Basquiat painting last year. These dynamics are not only unjust, they are setting us up for failure. To rapidly, radically reshape society, we need every solution and every solver, every mind, every bit of heart, every set of hands. We often crave a simple call to action, but this challenge demands more than a fact sheet and more than a checklist. We need to function more like an ecosystem, finding strength in our diversity. You know what your superpowers are. Youre an educator, farmer, healer, creator, campaigner, wisdom keeper. How might you link arms where you are to move solutions forward. There is one role I want to ask that all of you play, the role of messenger. This is a time of great awakening. We need to break the silence around the condition of our planet, move beyond manufactured debates about climate science, share solutions, speak truth with a broken open heart, teach that to address climate change, we must make gender equity a reality. And in the face of a seemingly impossible challenge, women and girls are a fierce source of possibility. It is a magnificent thing to be alive in a moment that matters so much. This earth, our home, is calling for us to be bold, reminding us we are all in this together, women, men, people of all gender identities, all beings. We are life force, one earth, one chance. Lets seize it. Thank you. "
"Ill tell you a little bit about my story and who I am. Im a fashion photographer based in New York City. Ive worked for lots of different magazines in New York, Ive worked for Elle and for Marie Claire, and for Interview and for GQ, and I got to work with some really beautiful people. My studio is in New York, but I also lived in Milan for about eight years, and in Paris as well, and worked for the house of Yves St. Laurent. I also did portraiture as well. Ive worked for lots of different magazines, lots of great clients. But I was always told, every single day, who was beautiful. I was forced to work within certain parameters of the beauty standard. I was told, This is the most amazing model of the moment, youve got to photograph her. Shes incredible, youve got to. And then the next season, it would change again, and Id have to shift my ideas of beauty, and so wed go to the next model, and it was kind of really crazy, because Im an artist. I saw beauty everywhere. I didnt see beauty just on a magazine cover. I did a shoot with, of course, Cindy, for Revlon, and really fantastic, beautiful people. But I thought, someones always telling me whos beautiful. And I was kind of frustrated. I left my studio one afternoon in New York, and I was walking down Park Avenue, and I saw, waiting for a bus at the corner of Park and 20th, this gorgeous kid. She had long, white, beautiful hair, and pale, pale skin. She had a genetic condition called albinism. I didnt know much about it, but she was stunning, and Id never met a model like this before. And I went to grab her and say, I have to take your photograph, youre amazing. And the bus came, she got on, and then she took off, and I was really glad because she was 12, and Id be in prison at the moment. But really, it was extraordinary to see this kid. So I continued right down to Union Square, to the huge Barnes and Noble, and started pulling any books, or any information I could about this genetic condition, albinism. And I found really kind of sad images. I didnt find images of this kid. I found images of people sitting in hospital beds, looking sad, looking downtrodden, just images of despair. I found images of a bright red eye, the albino eye. Im thinking, this kid had beautiful blue eyes, she didnt have red eyes. And then I started seeing images from Africa, where kids were surrounded by tribes pointing spears at them or in cancer wards and clinics, or theyre just in beds, and images of illness, of sadness, of sickness. And then, I started, of course, going through those same medical textbooks, and started finding these typical images of kids and adults in their underwear, against walls in doctors offices, with the black bar across their eyes saying disease. This is a disease, defined by a disease. And I was like, this is crazy. And then I started going into it further, looking on the Internet, and all these different medical textbooks, and everything was so sad, and so negative. I then started finding images of the albino freak family in the circus, and then of course, all the movie references, from Powder, who had albinism because his mother was struck by lightning, to The Princess Bride and to The Matrix Reloaded, there were the ghost like twins that came in and wreaked havoc, and destroyed things and then disappeared. Even most recently, The Da Vinci Code, there was like the evil albino driving around Paris at night, killing people, shooting at people. Well, I found out, through my research, that people with albinism have a visual impairment. Theres always vision, but theyre considered legally blind. So they certainly wouldnt be driving around Paris at night shooting at anybody and expect to hit anything. So Im thinking, this is crazy. So I contact NOAH. Now, NOAH is the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation. Its a support group for people living with this condition, and their families. And Im like, Hey, Im a fashion photographer. Lets show the world the beauty of albinism. And they said, Get lost. And Im pretty persistent. Im like, Wont you talk to me. And they made it very clear to me about their fears of exploitation, that every time there was a magazine article that came out about a kid with albinism, it was a story about a victim. It was sad, or it was exploitative, or sensational, never positive, always negative. And I said, Okay, well then, what do we do here. So, lets form a nontraditional partnership, fashion photographer, genetic support group, and well work together. And you can keep an eye on me to make sure that we create something positive and powerful, showing the world the beauty of albinism. And they said okay. And I was like, fantastic, lets do this. So in walks the first person Im about to photograph. Her name is Christine, and Christine is a knockout. Long white hair, really tall. Shes stunning. She walks into my studio. The way that she walks in, though, instead of this gorgeous girl, she walks in like this, her heads down, shoulders hunched, one word answers, she looks down, no eye contact. This kid has been teased her whole life because of her difference. And it was so apparent in the fact that it left her with zero self esteem. And Im thinking, oh, this kid is just so fragile. And just the day before, I was shooting Cindy on the same set, in my studio. Im thinking well, I have to be so careful with her, no, out of respect for this gorgeous kid, Im going to photograph her like I would anybody else. So the fan went on, the music went on, and I grabbed a mirror that was next to the set, and I held it up to her, and I said Christine, look at yourself. Youre magnificent. And she looked in the mirror, and she got it. And she went from this to that. And thats our Christine, and she just exploded in front of the set. By the time she left the studio, she was kissing everybody on both cheeks, and saying, Ciao. and she was unbelievable. And I saw this transformation right in front of the lens, through photography, that she was now transformed, with a powerful and positive sense of who she is. The next day, she goes to school, shes going to change the way her community sees her difference. Instead of walking into that classroom like this, shes walking in like this. So its all about ambassadors for change. It was extraordinary. And those first images, right after, we did a series of them, using several individuals with this condition, they were in Life magazine in 1998. So it was a while ago. It was a cover story, it was a five page spread. It was really a fantastic editorial. It was great. I loved it. Then we used a lot of the images, though, from Life, and put them in other magazines, magazines worldwide. Magazines in the U.K., in France, in Italy and Canada, and other magazines in the States. It was amazing. So this is from the U.K., Christine again. Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, and Kristen. Thats Lauren. We did a campaign for sunglasses. A lot of kids with this condition are photophobic, so they have a real strong light sensitivity. So we thought, perfect for a sunglass campaign. People magazine did a great story. So it was circulating, people were saying all this great stuff. It was fantastic. So I was getting calls, though. Getting calls from the U.K., saying, well we just saw this spread, can you come photograph our kids with this condition. We have a support group here, can you come meet our families. People in Africa were calling in the same. New Zealand, can you help us start a support group. Im like, fantastic. This is great. Lets do it. So I would travel in all these places, as I was shooting and doing my commercial work, I was at a local chapter conference in Philadelphia. Small family conference, about 40 families, did my presentation of kids with albinism, this mom came up to me, and she said, My son Randy, when he was a little boy, hed come home from school, and I could see the kids were teasing him, and hed be in tears. And Id buy him an ice cream cone, or a toy truck, and hed forget about it. She said, Now hes in high school. He comes home from school, I can see the pain, the anguish in his eyes. He walks in, he walks right past me, goes up to his room, slams the door, and I dont see him until the next day. Hes not going to want to be photographed, he has zero self esteem, this kid has such poor body image, and hes just so shy. But if you could just show him photographs of kids his own age, so that he knows hes not alone. Im like, Of course. Where is he. Show me. She points over to Randy. Now Randys sitting there, his pants are hanging down to here, his underwears hanging out, he has this long, great big shirt, he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo. Hes amazing, this kid. I crawl over to Randy. Im like, Randy, I speak to moms and dads every single day, terrified about the future of their kids with albinism. All they have to do is take one look at you, and theyre going to be fine. Please let me take a photo of you. Your mother said, she told me, that you didnt want to be photographed. He said, Rick, what do you mean. You have to understand, Im 16 years old. I dont talk to my mother. And then he said, I want to be photographed. I want to show the world that who I am, with my albinism, but also other things about me, You see how shy he was. Very, very shy, Randy. But Randy created, early days in this idea, of this nonprofit group Positive Exposure, the idea of networking stories, sharing experiences and the images around the world. Ill kind of quickly go through the album. I was very interested, at that point, getting calls from everybody in the world, to find out more about this idea, a message, about albinism, or perceptions of people in communities about this syndrome, albinism. So I started hearing about stigmas, and discrimination, so what I looked at is really trying to explore cultural perceptions and attitudes towards this condition. This is my friend unclear, whos a Kuna Indian in the San Blas region of the world, the San Blas region of Panama. Shes extraordinary. So the incidence of albinism is about one in 20,000 worldwide. In the Kuna Indian, its one in 125, the highest incidence in the world. We went to Fiji, actually, where we found out at the turn of the 19th century, a tribe could not hold their territory unless they had somebody with albinism in a powerful political position. My great friend Keke, I photographed in New Zealand, shes from India, from Delhi, but her family left Delhi because she was getting death threats. Now Im thinking, this is horrible that they had to move, because shes eight years old. And we actually started a support group in Delhi, we found out that there are many kids that we worked with in their communities, after we started this group in India, that have had really positive experiences. So one of the things we want to make very clear is that were not making generalizations about a community or a culture, and their reaction to people that are different. Kekes experiences were very different, but weve met many kids there that have been embraced by their communities throughout India. A great friend Sue Anna from Korea. Tom, who was just adopted by an American family, from China, This is my great friend Harry from Puerto Rico. And Natalia. She and I started the first albinism society in Russia. Maizan and her sister and mom in Malaysia. Ceara. All she ever wanted to do was be a dancer. She was told that because of her visual impairment, shell never dance. Shell never be able to follow the choreography or the dance steps. Shes like, they said, find another love, another passion. Shes like, no. Shes New Zealands Celtic dance champion, and just started a school for dance for kids with visual impairment. Im going to zip through this. Roz, from Australia. I spend a lot of time in Africa, where theres a high incidence of mortality associated with albinism, due to skin cancer. This is my friend Siri, who when she was born, the fathers family put her out of the house, thinking she was cursed. and Mom, not knowing what to do, put Siri in the sun to get her dark like her brothers and sisters. So you can see, its all sun damage. A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa were put in special schools, schools for the blind, not because the tools were better there for kids with visual impairment, but more importantly, because the teasing was so great, the discrimination is so great, these kids dont do well in mainstream schools. I started an albinism society in Kenya with my friend C.K., who actually went to a mainstream school. Im like, C.K., how is it possible you went to a mainstream school. Nobody in Africa goes to mainstream schools. She said, Its because of my twin sister, Delphine. Fantastic. She said Delphine would get all the work off the board, the things I couldnt see, shed help me with it. If the type was too small, shed blow it up for me, she said. But more importantly, when kids would tease me, Delphine would beat them up. But on a sadder note, I was spending a lot of time in Tanzania, where witch doctors are saying, bring me the bones of an albino, and Ill make a potion that will make you rich. So were working very closely with the government there, Ive been there six times in the last two years, to create public awareness programs to save these kids. This is the dancer. This is in the Shinyanga region. This is one of the visuals that we created in East Africa, trying to fight and educate the public. I received the Art of Reporting award, from an organization called the Chromosome 18 Registry. The larger organization was the Genetic Alliance, which was a coalition of all the genetic support groups, and it was the award for the Life magazine piece. The president at the time said, Im also the founder and director of the Chromosome 18 Research Society and Registry. Im like, fantastic. Thats great. Whats that. Shes like, well, if you have an anomaly on your 18th chromosome, then you have all kinds of problems and difficulties and challenges, and then we look after you, through this support group, like NOAH is. So Im like, thats great. She said, I see theres a universal message here, about all kids with differences, so its not just about albinism. Would you come and speak to our families in San Antonio with these chromosome 18 anomalies. Im like, sure. I went back to them thinking, what the hell is a chromosome 18 anomaly. I was an art major at the school of visual arts, I had no idea. But I looked it up, these are the images that I saw. Im thinking, albinism was so easy, this is going to be rough. But I went to San Antonio, walked down to the auditorium where the kids and young adults were, opened the door, and I was instantly surrounded by kids screaming with laughter. There were kids with cleft palates, kids with mobility issues, feeding tubes, trachs, but they were kids, first and foremost. Thats Rebecca and Pauline. My great friend, thats Ellington. Hes awesome. Remy. Thats Emory. Byron. Taylor. Elizabeth. And my great friend Sean. So we decided at that point to involve other organizations to be part of this larger exhibition that was going to be sent out from the Peoples Genome Celebration in 2001. The National Human Genome Research Institute and the Genetic Alliance invited me to create an exhibition at the Smithsonian, commemorating the mapping of the human genome. So we actually invited other genetic support groups to be part of this exhibition, not just on albinism, but all groups, again illustrating the universal applicability. I saw these images from the Marfan Foundation, these kids grow very, very tall, at risk of an aortic dissection, but theyre amazing kids, and I thought, how gorgeous. And I understood the importance of this image, how important it was to show how beautiful, and to show how the image presents itself. But isnt there another way to show it. Because nobody, and Ive photographed thousands of kids now, with Marfan Syndrome, and nobody stands like this, with a portable black bar. Its extraordinary. So we decided to put them in a pool, show Billy swimming, , show how it presents itself, but keep going, and keep presenting how these kids look, but put the humanity back in these gorgeous images. I only have a few seconds here, so Im going to go through. Cool girls at the Costello Conference. These are great friends Danielle and Maggie, who actually met at the last Costello Conference. For both, the first time they ever met anybody with the same syndrome. They go to the same conferences every year and I go and photograph them. And this year, they were there again in Florida, but this time its a little different. Theyre gangsters now. But theyre pretty amazing kids. I just want to talk very briefly about this really great kid, to talk very briefly about a project that were taking these images, and bringing them into high schools. I can photograph a great kid in my studio, and shes having a brilliant time, and she feels 10,000 feet tall. By the time she leaves my studio and gets to Park Avenue, five people point at her, point at her birthmark, or at her white hair, or her wheelchair. So we have to make it relevant for all of us, for all these kids, to make people understand what the idea of celebrating diversity actually means. So we started a project called the PEARLS Project, where these photographs are going into high schools, and the kids that are in the images are blogging, and the students are following their blogs. And they all have these great video intros. I just want to give you this last one, and this is actually Byron, who is actually one of our bloggers. Byron. Hi, my name is Byron. I live in the D.C. area. Im 14. When I was 10 months old, I had a left hemispherectomy. I had the left half of my brain removed, because I have something called Sturge Weber Syndrome. I wear a brace on my right leg and right arm. I only see out of the right side of each eye, so sometimes its harder for me to see things on the right side. So playing sports can be frustrating, because I might not see a ball coming. I didnt see that coming. Excuse me. So were using all the visual art to change public perceptions through these great kids. I feel as an artist, its my responsibility. I know that when I was a kid, and I saw someone that was different walking down the street, If I stared, I got slapped by my mom. So the idea was if you dont stare, look away. And I think as an artist, its my responsibility, and all of our responsibilities, to steady that gaze a little bit longer. Because you stand there, and youll see a difference. Youll start seeing beauty in that difference. And youll start seeing beautiful gorgeousness, and then this light just spreads, and once youre enlightened, it just changes your whole world. Its about seeing the beauty in all differences. Thank you so much, Im sorry I ran over. Thank you guys, thank you."
"I am no designer, nope, no way. My dad was, which is kind of an interesting way to grow up. I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important. Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up, you know, Bad design is just people not thinking, John, he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen. You know, Design, bad design, theres just no excuse for it. Its letting stuff happen without thinking about it. Every object should be about something, John. It should imagine a user. It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object. Good design, my dad said, is about supplying intent. Thats what he said. Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer. That was a big deal, that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while, that was important. He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase, that was important. I knew design was important in my house because, for heavens sake, it put food on our table, right. And design was in everything my dad did. He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up, and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes. And I would ask him every once in a while, Dad, do you want it to sound like the record. We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house. And he said, No, never, John, never. The song is just a given, thats how you have to think about it. You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it. Show everyone what you intend, is what he said. Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing. Its where we all belong. All of us. Designers. Oh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad. The song is just a given. Its how you cover it that matters. Well, lets hold on to that thought for just a minute. Its kind of like this wheelchair Im in, right. The original tune. Its a little scary. Ooh, what happened to that dude. He cant walk. Anybody know the story. Anybody. I dont like to talk about this very much, but Ill tell you guys the story today. All right, exactly 36 years ago this week, thats right, I was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania, and plummeted down a 200 foot embankment and killed two people in the car. But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life. My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design. Think about it. Now, in design terms, a wheelchair is a very difficult object. It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune, and it projects that message, that story, so strongly that it almost blots out anything else. I roll swiftly through an airport, right. And moms grab their kids out of the way and say, Dont stare. The poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think. And for decades, Im going, why does this happen. What can I do about it. How can I change this. I mean there must be something. So I would roll, Id make no eye contact, just kinda frown, right. Or Id dress up really, really sharply or something. Or Id make eye contact with everyone, that was really creepy, that didnt work at all. You know anything, Id try. I wouldnt shower for a week, nothing worked. Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago, my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said, Oh, Dad. Dad. Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels, you gotta get em. And I said, Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist, that just wouldnt do at all. And of course, they immediately concluded, Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists arent allowed to have flashy wheels. I mean, how important could you be then. they said. I went, Wait a minute, all right, right, Ill get the wheels. Purely out of protest, I got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and, check this out. Could I have my special light cue please. Look at that. Now ... look at, look at this. Look at this. So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life, I mean totally changed my life. Instead of blank stares and awkwardness, now it is pointing and smiling. People going, Awesome wheels, dude. Those are awesome. I mean, I want some of those wheels. Little kids say, Can I have a ride. And of course theres the occasional person, usually a middle aged male who will say, Oh, those wheels are great. I guess theyre for safety, right. No. Theyre not for safety. No, no, no, no, no. Whats the difference here, the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights. The difference is intent. Thats right, thats right. Im no longer a victim. I chose to change the situation, Im the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right. Intent changes the picture completely. I choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element. Acting with intent. It conveys authorship. It suggests that someone is driving. Its reassuring, people are drawn to it. Someone making the experience their own. Covering the tragic tune with something different, something radically different. People respond to that. Now it seems simple, but actually I think in our society and culture in general, we have a huge problem with intent. Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is. Its Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill in Olso, Norway last year, dozens and dozens of young people, if he intended to do that, hes a vicious criminal. We punish him. Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway. But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy, if he was motivated by some random mental illness, hes in a completely different category. We may put him away for life, but we watch him clinically. Its a completely different domain. As an intentional murderer, Anders Breivik is merely evil. But as a dysfunctional, as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic, hes something much more complicated. Hes the breath of some primitive, ancient chaos. Hes the random state of nature we emerged from. Hes something very, very different. Its as though intent is an essential component for humanity. Its what were supposed to do somehow. Were supposed to act with intent. Were supposed to do things by design. Intent is a marker for civilization. Now heres an example a little closer to home. My family is all about intent. You can probably tell there are two sets of twins, the result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology, due to some physical limitations I wont go into. Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF, is about as intentional as agriculture. Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience. In fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian. I met the dude. Hes a great guy. He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that hed worked with, all the different animals. Probes he designed, and in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes. He would say, Youre right between horse and squirrel, John. But anyway, so when my wife and I decided to upgrade our early middle age, we had four kids, after all, with a little different technology that I wont explain in too much detail here, my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about. No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that. John, John, I looked at your chart. From your sperm tests we can confidently say that youre basically a form of birth control. Well. What a liberating thought. Yes. And after a couple very liberating weekends, my wife and I, utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday but I wont get into it now, we noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms. I wasnt exactly a form of birth control. Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed. I mean, did a designer come up with that. No, I dont think a designer did come up with that. In fact, maybe thats the problem. And so, little Ajax was born. Hes like our other children, but the experience is completely different. Its something like my accident, right. He came out of nowhere. But we all had to change, but not just react to the given, we bend to this new experience with intent. Were five now. Five. Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design. Hey, the name Ajax, you cant get much more intentional than that, right. Were really hoping he thanks us for that later on. But I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close. I did love some great designs as I was growing up. The HP 35S calculator, God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one. Man, I love that thing. I could afford that. Other designs I really couldnt afford, like the 1974 911 Targa. In school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering. I studied useless things like the Classics, but there were some lessons even there, this guy, Plato, it turns out hes a designer. He designed a state in The Republic, a design never implemented. Listen to one of the design features of Platos Government 4.0, The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst. Well, got that wrong, didnt we. But look at that statement, its all about intent. Thats what I love about it. But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing. Its a grand idea of design, a huge idea of design, common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period. What was going on then. They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive. As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos, a confrontation with random, brutal nature, they suddenly had a moment to think, and there was a lot to think about. All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent. Human life needed a reason. Reality itself needed a designer. The given was replaced by various aspects of intent, by various designs, by various gods. Gods were still fighting about. Oh yeah. Today we dont confront the chaos of nature. Today it is the chaos of humanitys impact on the Earth itself that we confront. This young discipline called design, I think, is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question. What shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created. What shall we do. How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create, on all the circumstances we create, on all the places we change. The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting. Thats the tune were all covering today, all of us. And we cant just imitate the past. No. That wont do. That wont do at all. Heres my favorite design moment. In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s, I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire, who raped and pillaged that country. There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa. The place was falling apart, it was a horrible, horrible place, and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting. People were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings. Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests. In the middle of this chaos, Im rolling around in a wheelchair, and I was completely invisible. Completely. I was in a wheelchair. I didnt look like a looter. I was in a wheelchair. I didnt look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective. And I didnt look like a soldier, thats for sure. I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible. And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me, in this metal and wood and leather pedal, three wheel tricycle wheelchair device, and he pedals up to me as fast as he can. He goes, Hey, mister. Mister. And I looked at him, he didnt know any other English than that, but we didnt need English, no, no, no, no, no. We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes. And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism, he was full of pride over his design. I wish I could show you that contraption. His smile, our glow as we talked a universal language of design, invisible to the chaos around us. His machine, homemade, bolted, rusty, comical. My machine. American made, confident, sleek. He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge. Oh, I wish Id had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man. He would have loved those. Oh yeah. He would have understood those, a chariot of pure intent, think about it, in a city out of control. Design blew it all away for a moment. We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos. He went back to the streets of Kinshasa. I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ... And I pose this question. An object imbued with intent, it has power, its treasure, were drawn to it. An object devoid of intent, its random, its imitative, it repels us. Its like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away. This is what we must demand of our lives, of our objects, of our things, of our circumstances, living with intent. And I have to say that on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you. And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day. Thirty six years ago at nearly this moment, a 19 year old boy awoke from a coma to ask a nurse a question, but the nurse was already there with an answer. Youve had a terrible accident, young man. Youve broken your back. Youll never walk again. I said, I know all that, what day is it. You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February, and I knew that 1976 was a leap year. Nurse. Is this the 28th or the 29th. And she looked at me and said, Its March 1st. And I went, Oh my God. Ive got some catching up to do. And from that moment, I knew the given was that accident. I had no option but to make up this new life without walking. Intent, a life with intent, lived by design, covering the original with something better. Its something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times. To get back to this, to get back to design, and as my daddy suggested a long time ago, Make the song your own, John. Show everybody what you intend. Daddy, this ones for you. Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner but he was another man. Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona to attend a California bash. Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged. Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged. "
"Right now you have a movie playing inside your head. Its an amazing multi track movie. It has 3D vision and surround sound for what youre seeing and hearing right now, but thats just the start of it. Your movie has smell and taste and touch. It has a sense of your body, pain, hunger, orgasms. It has emotions, anger and happiness. It has memories, like scenes from your childhood playing before you. And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking. At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly. This movie is your stream of consciousness, the subject of experience of the mind and the world. Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence. Each of us is conscious. We all have our own inner movie, you and you and you. Theres nothing we know about more directly. At least, I know about my consciousness directly. I cant be certain that you guys are conscious. Consciousness also is what makes life worth living. If we werent conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value. But at the same time, its the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe. Why are we conscious. Why do we have these inner movies. Why arent we just robots who process all this input, produce all that output, without experiencing the inner movie at all. Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions. Im going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, some radical ideas may be needed. Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible. Science, by its nature, is objective. Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective. So there can never be a science of consciousness. For much of the 20th century, that view held sway. Psychologists studied behavior objectively, neuroscientists studied the brain objectively, and nobody even mentioned consciousness. Even 30 years ago, when TED got started, there was very little scientific work on consciousness. Now, about 20 years ago, all that began to change. Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness. And since then, theres been a real explosion, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness. And this work has been wonderful. Its been great. But it also has some fundamental limitations so far. The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations, correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness. We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago. Now we understand much better, for example, the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy. But this is still a science of correlations. Its not a science of explanations. We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience, but we dont know why they do. I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness, the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with. But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems. No knock on the neuroscientists. There are no truly easy problems with consciousness. But it doesnt address the real mystery at the core of this subject, why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all. Why is there this inner subjective movie. Right now, we dont really have a bead on that. And you might say, lets just give neuroscience a few years. Itll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams, like hurricanes, like life, and well figure it out. The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior, how a traffic jam behaves, how a hurricane functions, how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes, all questions about objective functioning. You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena, how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess, all these questions about behavior. But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems. When it comes to the hard problem, thats the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience. And here, the standard paradigm of emergence, even the standard paradigms of neuroscience, dont really, so far, have that much to say. Now, Im a scientific materialist at heart. I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works, and for a long time, I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work. But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didnt work for systematic reasons. Its a long story, but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain based terms, is stories about the functioning of a system, its structure, its dynamics, the behavior it produces, great for solving the easy problems, how we behave, how we function, but when it comes to subjective experience, why does all this feel like something from the inside., thats something fundamentally new, and its always a further question. So I think were at a kind of impasse here. Weve got this wonderful, great chain of explanation, were used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psychology. But consciousness doesnt seem to fit into this picture. On the one hand, its a datum that were conscious. On the other hand, we dont know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world. So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly, one that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we dont yet see how. Faced with an anomaly like this, radical ideas may be needed, and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically. Now, there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be. My friend Dan Dennett, whos here today, has one. His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness. The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion. Actually, all weve got to do is explain the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain, and then weve explained everything that needs to be explained. Well I say, more power to him. Thats the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain based theory of consciousness. At the same time, for me and for many other people, that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory. So I go in a different direction. In the time remaining, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise. The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental. Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks, space and time and mass. They postulate fundamental laws governing them, like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics. These fundamental properties and laws arent explained in terms of anything more basic. Rather, theyre taken as primitive, and you build up the world from there. Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands. In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out that you cant explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals, space, time, mass, Newtons laws, so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern. I think thats the situation were in with consciousness. If you cant explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals, space, time, mass, charge, then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list. The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature. This doesnt mean you suddenly cant do science with it. This opens up the way for you to do science with it. What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals, space, time, mass, physical processes. Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t shirt. Well I think something like that is the situation were in with consciousness. We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t shirt. We dont know what those laws are yet, but thats what were after. The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. Every system might have some degree of consciousness. This view is sometimes called panpsychism, pan for all, psych for mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, but even Rob Knights microbes, elementary particles. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. Its not that a photon is wracked with angst because its thinking, Aww, Im always buzzing around near the speed of light. I never get to slow down and smell the roses. No, not like that. But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw, subjective feeling, some primitive precursor to consciousness. This may sound a bit kooky to you. I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing. Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental. If its fundamental, like space and time and mass, its natural to suppose that it might be universal too, the way they are. Its also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us, its much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures, where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature. A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information. Wherever theres information processing, theres consciousness. Complex information processing, like in a human, complex consciousness. Simple information processing, simple consciousness. A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi, has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory. He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi, measuring the amount of information integrated in a system. And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness. So in a human brain, incredibly large amount of information integration, high degree of phi, a whole lot of consciousness. In a mouse, medium degree of information integration, still pretty significant, pretty serious amount of consciousness. But as you go down to worms, microbes, particles, the amount of phi falls off. The amount of information integration falls off, but its still non zero. On Tononis theory, theres still going to be a non zero degree of consciousness. In effect, hes proposing a fundamental law of consciousness, high phi, high consciousness. Now, I dont know if this theory is right, but its actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and its been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t shirt. Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world. Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract. It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesnt tell us about the reality that underlies it. As Stephen Hawking puts it, what puts the fire into the equations. Well, on the panpsychist view, you can leave the equations of physics as they are, but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness. Thats what physics really is ultimately doing, describing the flux of consciousness. On this view, its consciousness that puts the fire into the equations. On that view, consciousness doesnt dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra. Its there right at its heart. This view, I think, the panpsychist view, has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature, and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences. Some of these may be counterintuitive. I used to think I shouldnt eat anything which is conscious, so therefore I should be vegetarian. Now, if youre a panpsychist and you take that view, youre going to go very hungry. So I think when you think about it, this tends to transfigure your views, whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations, not so much the fact of consciousness, but the degree and the complexity of consciousness. Its also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers. What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie Her, Samantha. Is she conscious. Well, if you take the informational, panpsychist view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integration, so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious. If thats right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off. Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, the planet. Does Canada have its own consciousness. Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts. I dont know the answer to that question, but I think its at least one worth taking seriously. Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I dont know that its correct. Im actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, than about the second one, that its universal. I mean, the view raises any number of questions, has any number of challenges, like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love. If we can answer those questions, then I think were going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness. If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy. We cant expect to solve it overnight. But I do think were going to figure it out eventually. Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think, both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves. It may just take the right crazy idea. Thank you. "
"Well, as many of you know, the results of the recent election were as follows. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate won a landslide victory with 52 percent of the overall vote. Jill Stein, the Green candidate, came a distant second, with 19 percent. Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate, was hot on her heels with 14 percent, and the remainder of the vote were shared between abstainers and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Now, what parallel universe do you suppose I live in. Well, I dont live in a parallel universe. I live in the world, and that is how the world voted. So let me take you back and explain what I mean by that. In June this year, I launched something called the Global Vote. And the Global Vote does exactly what it says on the tin. For the first time in history, it lets anybody, anywhere in the world, vote in the elections of other peoples countries. Now, why would you do that. Whats the point. Well, let me show you what it looks like. You go to a website, rather a beautiful website, and then you select an election. Heres a bunch that weve already covered. We do about one a month, or thereabouts. So you can see Bulgaria, the United States of America, Secretary General of the United Nations, the Brexit referendum at the end there. You select the election that youre interested in, and you pick the candidates. These are the candidates from the recent presidential election in the tiny island nation of Sao Tome and Principe, 199,000 inhabitants, off the coast of West Africa. And then you can look at the brief summary of each of those candidates which I dearly hope is very neutral, very informative and very succinct. And when youve found the one you like, you vote. These were the candidates in the recent Icelandic presidential election, and thats the way it goes. So why on earth would you want to vote in another countrys election. Well, the reason that you wouldnt want to do it, let me reassure you, is in order to interfere in the democratic processes of another country. Thats not the purpose at all. In fact, you cant, because usually what I do is I release the results after the electorate in each individual country has already voted, so theres no way that we could interfere in that process. But more importantly, Im not particularly interested in the domestic issues of individual countries. Thats not what were voting on. So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton proposed to do for the Americans is frankly none of our business. Thats something that only the Americans can vote on. No, in the global vote, youre only considering one aspect of it, which is what are those leaders going to do for the rest of us. And thats so very important because we live, as no doubt youre sick of hearing people tell you, in a globalized, hyperconnected, massively interdependent world where the political decisions of people in other countries can and will have an impact on our lives no matter who we are, no matter where we live. Like the wings of the butterfly beating on one side of the Pacific that can apparently create a hurricane on the other side, so it is with the world that we live in today and the world of politics. There is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs. Any country, no matter how small, even if its Sao Tome and Principe, could produce the next Nelson Mandela or the next Stalin. They could pollute the atmosphere and the oceans, which belong to all of us, or they could be responsible and they could help all of us. And yet, the system is so strange because the system hasnt caught up with this globalized reality. Only a small number of people are allowed to vote for those leaders, even though their impact is gigantic and almost universal. What number was it. 140 million Americans voted for the next president of the United States, and yet, as all of us knows, in a few weeks time, somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes to Donald J. Trump. Now, if that isnt having a potential impact on all of us, I dont know what is. Similarly, the election for the referendum on the Brexit vote, a small number of millions of British people voted on that, but the outcome of the vote, whichever way it went, would have had a significant impact on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions of people around the world. And yet, only a tiny number could vote. What kind of democracy is that. Huge decisions that affect all of us being decided by relatively very small numbers of people. And I dont know about you, but I dont think that sounds very democratic. So Im trying to clear it up. But as I say, we dont ask about domestic questions. In fact, I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates. I send them the same two questions every single time. I say, one, if you get elected, what are you going to do for the rest of us, for the remainder of the seven billion who live on this planet. Second question. What is your vision for your countrys future in the world. What role do you see it playing. Every candidate, I send them those questions. They dont all answer. Dont get me wrong. I reckon if youre standing to become the next president of the United States, youre probably pretty tied up most of the time, so Im not altogether surprised that they dont all answer, but many do. More every time. And some of them do much more than answer. Some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine. I just want to say a word here for Saviour Chishimba, who was one of the candidates in the recent Zambian presidential election. His answers to those two questions were basically an 18 page dissertation on his view of Zambias potential role in the world and in the international community. I posted it on the website so anybody could read it. Now, Saviour won the global vote, but he didnt win the Zambian election. So I found myself wondering, what am I going to do with this extraordinary group of people. Ive got some wonderful people here who won the global vote. We always get it wrong, by the way. The one that we elect is never the person whos elected by the domestic electorate. That may be partly because we always seem to go for the woman. But I think it may also be a sign that the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally. Theyre still thinking very inwardly. Theyre still asking themselves. Whats in it for me. ... instead of what they should be asking today, which is, whats in it for we. But there you go. So suggestions, please, not right now, but send me an email if youve got an idea about what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers. Weve got Saviour Chishimba, who I mentioned before. Weve got Halla Tomasdottir, who was the runner up in the Icelandic presidential election. Many of you may have seen her amazing talk at TEDWomen just a few weeks ago where she spoke about the need for more women to get into politics. Weve got Maria das Neves from Sao Tome and Principe. Weve got Hillary Clinton. I dont know if shes available. Weve got Jill Stein. And we covered also the election for the next Secretary General of the United Nations. Weve got the ex prime minister of New Zealand, who would be a wonderful member of the team. So I think maybe those people, the glorious losers club, could travel around the world wherever theres an election and remind people of the necessity in our modern age of thinking a little bit outwards and thinking of the international consequences. So what comes next for the global vote. Well, obviously, the Donald and Hillary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow, but there are some other really important elections coming up. In fact, they seem to be multiplying. Theres something going on, Im sure youve noticed, in the world. And the next row of elections are all critically important. In just a few days time weve got the rerun of the Austrian presidential election, with the prospect of Norbert Hofer becoming what is commonly described as the first far right head of state in Europe since the Second World War. Next year weve got Germany, weve got France, weve got presidential elections in Iran and a dozen others. It doesnt get less important. It gets more and more important. Clearly, the global vote is not a stand alone project. Its not just there on its own. It has some background. Its part of a project which I launched back in 2014, which I call the Good Country. The idea of the Good Country is basically very simple. Its my simple diagnosis of whats wrong with the world and how we can fix it. Whats wrong with the world Ive already hinted at. Basically, we face an enormous and growing number of gigantic, existential global challenges, climate change, human rights abuses, mass migration, terrorism, economic chaos, weapons proliferation. All of these problems which threaten to wipe us out are by their very nature globalized problems. No individual country has the capability of tackling them on its own. And so very obviously we have to cooperate and we have to collaborate as nations if were going to solve these problems. Its so obvious, and yet we dont. We dont do it nearly often enough. Most of the time, countries still persist in behaving as if they were warring, selfish tribes battling against each other, much as they have done since the nation state was invented hundreds of years ago. And this has got to change. This is not a change in political systems or a change in ideology. This is a change in culture. We, all of us, have to understand that thinking inwards is not the solution to the worlds problems. We have to learn how to cooperate and collaborate a great deal more and compete just a tiny bit less. Otherwise things are going to carry on getting bad and theyre going to get much worse, much sooner than we anticipate. This change will only happen if we ordinary people tell our politicians that things have changed. We have to tell them that the culture has changed. We have to tell them that theyve got a new mandate. The old mandate was very simple and very single, if youre in a position of power or authority, youre responsible for your own people and your own tiny slice of territory, and thats it. And if in order to do the best thing for your own people, you screw over everybody else on the planet, thats even better. Thats considered to be a bit macho. Today, I think everybody in a position of power and responsibility has got a dual mandate, which says if youre in a position of power and responsibility, youre responsible for your own people and for every single man, woman, child and animal on the planet. Youre responsible for your own slice of territory and for every single square mile of the earths surface and the atmosphere above it. And if you dont like that responsibility, you should not be in power. That for me is the rule of the modern age, and thats the message that weve got to get across to our politicians, and show them that thats the way things are done these days. Otherwise, were all screwed. I dont have a problem, actually, with Donald Trumps credo of America first. It seems to me that thats a pretty banal statement of what politicians have always done and probably should always do. Of course theyre elected to represent the interests of their own people. But what I find so boring and so old fashioned and so unimaginative about his take on that is that America first means everyone else last, that making America great again means making everybody else small again, and its just not true. In my job as a policy advisor over the last 20 years or so, Ive seen so many hundreds of examples of policies that harmonize the international and the domestic needs, and they make better policy. Im not asking nations to be altruistic or self sacrificing. That would be ridiculous. No nation would ever do that. Im asking them to wake up and understand that we need a new form of governance, which is possible and which harmonizes those two needs, those good for our own people and those good for everybody else. Since the US election and since Brexit its become more and more obvious to me that those old distinctions of left wing and right wing no longer make sense. They really dont fit the pattern. What does seem to matter today is very simple, whether your view of the world is that you take comfort from looking inwards and backwards, or whether, like me, you find hope in looking forwards and outwards. Thats the new politics. Thats the new division that is splitting the world right down the middle. Now, that may sound judgmental, but its not meant to be. I dont at all misunderstand why so many people find their comfort in looking inwards and backwards. When times are difficult, when youre short of money, when youre feeling insecure and vulnerable, its almost a natural human tendency to turn inwards, to think of your own needs and to discard everybody elses, and perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better than the present or the future could ever be. But I happen to believe that thats a dead end. History shows us that its a dead end. When people turn inwards and turn backwards, human progress becomes reversed and things get worse for everybody very quickly indeed. If youre like me and you believe in forwards and outwards, and you believe that the best thing about humanity is its diversity, and the best thing about globalization is the way that it stirs up that diversity, that cultural mixture to make something more creative, more exciting, more productive than theres ever been before in human history, then, my friends, weve got a job on our hands, because the inwards and backwards brigade are uniting as never before, and that creed of inwards and backwards, that fear, that anxiety, playing on the simplest instincts, is sweeping across the world. Those of us who believe, as I believe, in forwards and outwards, we have to get ourselves organized, because time is running out very, very quickly. Thank you. "
"If nothing else, at least Ive discovered what it is we put our speakers through, sweaty palms, sleepless nights, a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. I mean, its quite brutal. And Im also a little nervous about this. There are nine billion humans coming our way. Now, the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet. But recently, Ive become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds, because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool. Its a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into. It certainly impacted the way we think about TEDs future, and perhaps the worlds future overall. So, lets explore. The story starts with just a single person, a child, behaving a little strangely. This kid is known online as Lil Demon. Hes doing tricks here, dance tricks, that probably no six year old in history ever managed before. How did he learn them. And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken. Heres a clue. Step your game up. Oh. Oh. Step your game up. Oh. Oh. So, that was sent to me by this man, a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu, who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve. This is what he said at TED in February. In essence, dancers were challenging each other online to get better, incredible new dance skills were being invented, even the six year olds were joining in. It felt like a revolution. And so Jon had a brilliant idea. He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe, The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD. I mean, these kids were web taught, but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. And at TED here in February, their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. So, this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off, we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation. It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two. ... Months of preparation crammed into 18 minutes, raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers, with the effects that weve seen this week. Its not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying, Step your game up, but they might as well have. So, in both of these cases, youve got these cycles of improvement, apparently driven by people watching web video. What is going on here. Well, I think its the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call crowd accelerated innovation. And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel. You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn. And the first thing you need is ... a crowd, a group of people who share a common interest. The bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are. Thats important, but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles. Theyre creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges. The second thing you need is light. You need clear, open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of, because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate. And third, you need desire. You know, innovations hard work. Its based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice. Absent desire, not going to happen. Now, heres an example, preInternet, of this machine in action. Dancers at a street corner, its a crowd, a small one, but they can all obviously see what each other can do. And the desire part comes, I guess, from social status, right. Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date. Theres probably going to be some innovation happening here. But on the web, all three dials are ratcheted right up. The dance community is now global. Theres millions connected. And amazingly, you can still see what the best can do, because the crowd itself shines a light on them, either directly, through comments, ratings, email, Facebook, Twitter, or indirectly, through numbers of views, through links that point Google there. So, its easy to find the good stuff, and when youve found it, you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it. Thats a lot of light. But the desire element is really dialed way up. I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam, but if you can do something that goes viral, you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people. You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. And even if its not that eloquent, and its not, it can still really make your day. So, this possibility of a new type of global recognition, I think, is driving huge amounts of effort. And its important to note that its not just the stars who are benefiting, because you can see the best, everyone can learn. Also, the system is self fueling. Its the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire, but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd. So, this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. Invite the crowd, let in the light, dial up the desire. And the hardest part about that is probably the light, because it means you have to open up, you have to show your stuff to the world. Its by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it. And, very happily, theres one class of people who really cant make use of this tool. The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. I dont think were going to see terrorists, for example, publishing their plans online and saying to the world, Please, could you help us to actually make them work this time. But you can publish your stuff online. And if you can get that wheel to turn, look out. So, at TED, weve become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it radical openness, because it works for us each time. We opened up our talks to the world, and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ideas, and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers. By opening up our translation program, thousands of heroic volunteers, some of them watching online right now, and thank you., have translated our talks into more than 70 languages, thereby tripling our viewership in non English speaking countries. By giving away our TEDx brand, we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas. And these organizers, theyre seeing each other, theyre learning from each other. We are learning from them. Were getting great talks back from them. The wheel is turning. Okay, step back a minute. I mean, its really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. You know, weve heard that this week, this romantic notion of the lone genius with the eureka. moment that changes the world is misleading. Even he said that, and he would know. Were a social species. We spark off each other. Its also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. For the past 15 years, powerful communities have been connecting online, sparking off each other. If you take programmers, you know, the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation. But whats key here is, the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally, a picture, a music file, software. And thats why what Im excited about, and what I think is under reported, is the significance of the rise of online video. This is the technology thats going to allow the rest of the worlds talents to be shared digitally, thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. The first few years of the web were pretty much video free, for this reason, video files are huge, the web couldnt handle them. But in the last 10 years, bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. Suddenly, here we are. Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day. Cisco actually estimates that, within four years, more than 90 percent of the webs data will be video. If its all puppies, porn and piracy, were doomed. I dont think it will be. Video is high bandwidth for a reason. It packs a huge amount of data, and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber. Hes a unicyclist. Before YouTube, there was no way for him to discover his sports true potential, because you cant communicate this stuff in words, right. But looking at video clips posted by strangers, a world of possibility opens up for him. Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate. And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online, inspire each other to greatness. And there are thousands of other examples of this happening, of video driven evolution of skills, ranging from the physical to the artful. And I have to tell you, as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines, I find this strangely beautiful. I mean, theres a lot of passion right here on this screen. But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry arent quite your cup of tea, how about this. Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video. Theres a problem with a traditional scientific paper. It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print. Heres one such frustrated scientist, Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove. He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this. But look at this video. I mean, look, if you can show instead of just describing, that problem goes away. So its not far fetched to say that, at some point, online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. Heres another example thats close to our hearts at TED, where video is sometimes more powerful than print, the sharing of an idea. Why do people like watching TEDTalks. All those ideas are already out there in print. Its actually faster to read than to view. Why would someone bother. Well, so, theres some showing as well as telling. But even leaving the screen out of it, theres still a lot more being transferred than just words. And in that non verbal portion, theres some serious magic. Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures, the vocal cadence, the facial expressions, the eye contact, the passion, the kind of awkward, British body language, the sense of how the audience are reacting, there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand, and whether youre inspired, light, if you like, and desire. Incredibly, all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions. Face to face communication has been fine tuned by millions of years of evolution. Thats whats made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is. Someone speaks, theres resonance in all these receiving brains, the whole group acts together. I mean, this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. Its probably driven our culture for millennia. 500 years ago, it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. Its right here. Print scaled. The worlds ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide, and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine. But now, in the blink of an eye, the game has changed again. Its not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face to face communication. So, that primal medium, which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... that just went global. Now, this is big. We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. I mean, today, one person speaking can be seen by millions, shedding bright light on potent ideas, creating intense desire for learning and to respond, and in his case, intense desire to laugh. For the first time in human history, talented students dont have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. They can sit two feet in front of the worlds finest. Now, TED is just a small part of this. I mean, the worlds universities are opening up their curricula. Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and, crucially, to respond, completing the cycle. And so, as weve thought about this, you know, its become clear to us what the next stage of TEDs evolution has to be. TEDTalks cant be a one way process, one to many. Our future is many to many. So, were dreaming of ways to make it easier for you, the global TED community, to respond to speakers, to contribute your own ideas, maybe even your own TEDTalks, and to help shine a light on the very best of whats out there. Because, if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool, this wheel turns. Now, is it possible to imagine a similar process to this, happening to global education overall. I mean, does it have to be this painful, top down process. Why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate. Its the participation age, right. Schools cant be silos. We cant stop learning at age 21. What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ... what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors, instead of net plunderers. That changes everything, right. I mean, that would take more teachers than weve ever had. But the good news is they are out there. Theyre in the crowd, and the crowd is switching on lights, and we can see them for the first time, not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers, but as individuals we can learn from. Whos the teacher. Youre the teacher. Youre part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history, a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place. Heres a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up. Within five years, each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video and capable of uploading video to the web. I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl, in the back, at the right, in 15 years, might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren. Its not crazy, its actually happening right now. I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africas biggest shantytown. Hi. My name is Christopher Makau. Im one of the organizers of TEDxKibera. There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. Theres a self help group. They turned a trash place into a garden. The same spot, it was a crime spot where people were being robbed. They used the same trash to form green manure. The same trash site is feeding more than 30 families. We have our own film school. They are using Flip cameras to record, edit, and reporting to their own channel, Kibera TV. Because of a scarcity of land, we are using the sacks to grow vegetables, and also were able to save on the cost of living. Change happens when we see things in a different way. Today, I see Kibera in a different way. My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is. Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. You know what. I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy. Whats new, and its huge, is that, for the first time, we get to see him, and he can see us. Right now, Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us, in Nairobi, right now. Guys, weve learned from you today. Thank you. And thank you. "
"So I want to talk today about money and happiness, which are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about, either trying to earn them or trying to increase them. And a lot of us resonate with this phrase, we see it in religions and self help books, money cant buy happiness. And I want to suggest today that, in fact, thats wrong. Im at a business school, so thats what we do. So thats wrong, and in fact, if you think that, youre just not spending it right. So instead of spending it the way you usually spend it, maybe if you spent it differently, that might work a little bit better. Before I tell you the ways you can spend it that will make you happier, lets think about the ways we usually spend it that dont, in fact, make us happier. We had a little natural experiment. So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery. It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives will be amazing. This articles about how their lives get ruined. What happens when people win the lottery is, one, they spend all the money and go into debt, and two, all of their friends and everyone theyve ever met find them and bug them for money. It ruins their social relationships, in fact. So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery. What was interesting about the article was, people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing. And instead of talking about how it made them realize that money doesnt lead to happiness, everyone started saying, You know what Id do if I won the lottery .... and fantasizing about what theyd do. Heres just two of the ones we saw that are interesting to think about. One person wrote, When I win, Im going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top. And another person wrote, I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne. This is even worse, ... then Id have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made. Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else. And so many of the comments were exactly of this type, where people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial. So I told you it ruins peoples lives and their friends bug them. Also, money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves. We thought maybe the reason money doesnt make us happy is that were spending it on the wrong things, in particular, were always spending it on ourselves. And we wondered what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on others. So instead of being antisocial with your money, what if you were more pro social with it. We thought, lets make people do it and see what happens. Lets have some people do what they usually do, spend money on themselves, and lets make some people give money away, and measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier. The first way we did this was, one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia, approached people and said, Do you want to be in an experiment. They said, Yes. We asked them how happy they were, and then gave them an envelope. One of the envelopes had things in it that said, By 5pm today, spend this money on yourself. We gave some examples of what you could spend it on. Other people got a slip of paper that said, By 5pm today, spend this money on somebody else. Also inside the envelope was money. And we manipulated how much money we gave them, some people got this slip of paper and five dollars, some got this slip of paper and 20 dollars. We let them go about their day and do whatever they wanted. We found out they did spend it in the way we asked them to. We called them up and asked them, What did you spend it on. How happy do you feel now. What did they spend it on. These are college undergrads, a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup. One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece. People gave money to homeless people. Huge effect here of Starbucks. So if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to them, and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can. Some people bought coffee for themselves, the way they usually would, but others bought coffee for somebody else. So the very same purchase, just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else. What did we find when we called at the end of the day. People who spent money on others got happier, people who spent it on themselves, nothing happened. It didnt make them less happy, it just didnt do much for them. The other thing we saw is the amount of money doesnt matter much. People thought 20 dollars would be way better than five. In fact, it doesnt matter how much money you spent. What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself. We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on others instead of on themselves. Of course, these are undergraduates in Canada, not the worlds most representative population. Theyre also fairly wealthy and affluent and other sorts of things. We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries. So we went to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment. Imagine, instead of just people in Canada, we say, Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others. Describe it. How happy did it make you. Or in Uganda, Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others and describe that. Then we asked them how happy they are, again. And what we see is sort of amazing, because theres human universals on what you do with your money, and real cultural differences on what you do as well. So for example, one guy from Uganda says this, I called a girl I wished to love. They basically went out on a date, and he says at the end that he didnt achieve her up till now. Heres a guy from Canada. Very similar thing. I took my girlfriend out for dinner. We went to a movie, we left early, and then went back to her room for ... cake, just cake. Human universal, you spend money on others, youre being nice. Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not. But then we see extraordinary differences. So look at these two. This is a woman from Canada. We say, Name a time you spent money on somebody else. She says, I bought a present for my mom. I drove to the mall, bought a present, gave it to my mom. Perfectly nice thing to do. Its good to get gifts for people you know. Compare that to this woman from Uganda, I was walking and met a longtime friend whose son was sick with malaria. They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money. This isnt USD 10,000, its the local currency. So its a very small amount of money, in fact. But enormously different motivations here. This is a real medical need, literally a lifesaving donation. Above, its just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother. What we see again, though, is that the specific way you spend on other people isnt nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy, which is really quite important. So you dont have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy. You can do small, trivial things and still get the benefits from doing this. These are only two countries. We wanted to look at every country in the world if we could, to see what the relationship is between money and happiness. We got data from the Gallup Organization, which you know from all the political polls happening lately. They asked people, Did you donate money to charity recently. and, How happy are you with life in general. We can see what the relationship is between those two things. Are they positively correlated, giving money makes you happy. Or are they negatively correlated. On this map, green will mean theyre positively correlated, red means theyre negatively correlated. And you can see, the world is crazily green. So in almost every country in the world where we have this data, people who give money to charity are happier people than people who dont give money to charity. I know youre looking at the red country in the middle. I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is, but its Central African Republic. You can make up stories. Maybe its different there for some reason. Just below that to the right is Rwanda, though, which is amazingly green. So almost everywhere we look, we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself. What about work, which is where we spend the rest of our time, when were not with the people we know. We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing. These are sales teams in Belgium. They work in teams, go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs. We can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team. We give people on some teams some money Spend it however you want on yourself, just like we did with the undergrads in Canada. To other teams we say, Heres 15 euro. Spend it on one of your teammates. Buy them something as a gift and give it to them. Then we can see, weve got teams that spend on themselves and these pro social teams who we give money to make the team better. The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one team pooled their money and bought a pinata, they smashed the pinata, the candy fell out and things like that. A silly, trivial thing to do, but think of the difference on a team that didnt do that at all, that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket, maybe bought themselves a coffee, or teams that had this pro social experience where they bonded together to buy something and do a group activity. What we see is that the teams that are pro social sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves. One way to think of it is, for every 15 euro you give people for themselves, they put it in their pocket and dont do anything different than before. You dont get money from that, you lose money, since it doesnt motivate them to perform better. But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates, they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money. Youre probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine, but theres a context thats incredibly important for public policy, and I cant imagine it would work there. And if he doesnt show me that it works here, I dont believe anything he said. I know what youre all thinking about are dodgeball teams. This was a huge criticism that we got, that if you cant show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid. So we went and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them, and did the exact same thing as before. So we give people on some teams money to spend on themselves. Other teams, we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates. The teams that spend money on themselves have the same winning percentages as before. The teams we give the money to spend on each other become different teams, they dominate the league by the time theyre done. Across all of these different contexts, your personal life, you work life, even things like intramural sports, we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself. So if you think money cant buy happiness, youre not spending it right. The implication isnt you should buy this product instead of that product, and thats the way to make yourself happier. Its that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself, and try giving some of it to other people instead. And we luckily have an opportunity for you. DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit for mainly public school teachers in low income schools. They post projects like, I want to teach Huckleberry Finn and we dont have the books, or, I want a microscope to teach my students science and we dont have a microscope. You and I can go on and buy it for them. The teacher and the kids write you thank you notes, sometimes they send pictures of them using the microscope. Its an extraordinary thing. Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking less about How can I spend money on myself. and more about If Ive got five dollars or 15 dollars, what can I do to benefit other people. Ultimately, when you do that, youll find you benefit yourself much more. Thank you. "
"So, this happy pic of me was taken in 1999. I was a senior in college, and it was right after a dance practice. I was really, really happy. And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later. I was sitting in the back of my used minivan in a campus parking lot, when I decided I was going to commit suicide. I went from deciding to full blown planning very quickly. And I came this close to the edge of the precipice. Its the closest Ive ever come. And the only reason I took my finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky coincidences. And after the fact, thats what scared me the most, the element of chance. So I became very methodical about testing different ways that I could manage my ups and downs, which has proven to be a good investment. Many normal people might have, say, six to 10 major depressive episodes in their lives. I have bipolar depression. It runs in my family. Ive had 50 plus at this point, and Ive learned a lot. Ive had a lot of at bats, many rounds in the ring with darkness, taking good notes. So I thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success or highlight reel, I would share my recipe for avoiding self destruction, and certainly self paralysis. And the tool Ive found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually the same tool that has helped me to make my best business decisions. But that is secondary. And it is ... stoicism. That sounds boring. You might think of Spock, or it might conjure and image like this, a cow standing in the rain. Its not sad. Its not particularly happy. Its just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way. You might not think of the ultimate competitor, say, Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots, who has the all time NFL record for Super Bowl titles. And stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the NFL ranks as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years. You might not think of the Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington to name but three students of stoicism. George Washington actually had a play about a Stoic, this was Cato, a Tragedy, performed for his troops at Valley Forge to keep them motivated. So why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy. This seems very academic. I would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently, as an operating system for thriving in high stress environments, for making better decisions. And it all started here, kind of, on a porch. So around 300 BC in Athens, someone named Zeno of Citium taught many lectures walking around a painted porch, a stoa. That later became stoicism. And in the Greco Roman world, people used stoicism as a comprehensive system for doing many, many things. But for our purposes, chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control, and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former. This decreases emotional reactivity, which can be a superpower. Conversely, lets say youre a quarterback. You miss a pass. You get furious with yourself. That could cost you a game. If youre a CEO, and you fly off the handle at a very valued employee because of a minor infraction, that could cost you the employee. If youre a college student who, say, is in a downward spiral, and you feel helpless and hopeless, unabated, that could cost you your life. So the stakes are very, very high. And there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there. Im going to focus on one that completely changed my life in 2004. It found me then because of two things, a very close friend, young guy, my age, died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly, and then my girlfriend, who I thought I was going to marry, walked out. Shed had enough, and she didnt give me a Dear John letter, but she did give me this, a Dear John plaque. Im not making this up. Ive kept it. Business hours are over at five oclock. She gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health, because at the time, I was working on my first real business. I had no idea what I was doing. I was working 14 plus hour days, seven days a week. I was using stimulants to get going. I was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep. It was a disaster. I felt completely trapped. I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers. And I did find a quote that made a big difference in my life, which was, We suffer more often in imagination than in reality, by Seneca the Younger, who was a famous Stoic writer. That took me to his letters, which took me to the exercise, premeditatio malorum, which means the premeditation of evils. In simple terms, this is visualizing the worst case scenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis. My problem was monkey mind, super loud, very incessant. Just thinking my way through problems doesnt work. I needed to capture my thoughts on paper. So I created a written exercise that I called fear setting, like goal setting, for myself. It consists of three pages. Super simple. The first page is right here. What if I .... This is whatever you fear, whatever is causing you anxiety, whatever youre putting off. It could be asking someone out, ending a relationship, asking for a promotion, quitting a job, starting a company. It could be anything. For me, it was taking my first vacation in four years and stepping away from my business for a month to go to London, where I could stay in a friends room for free, to either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business or shut it down. In the first column, Define, youre writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening if you take that step. You want 10 to 20. I wont go through all of them, but Ill give you two examples. One was, Ill go to London, itll be rainy, Ill get depressed, the whole thing will be a huge waste of time. Number two, Ill miss a letter from the IRS, and Ill get audited or raided or shut down or some such. And then you go to the Prevent column. In that column, you write down the answer to. What could I do to prevent each of these bullets from happening, or, at the very least, decrease the likelihood even a little bit. So for getting depressed in London, I could take a portable blue light with me and use it for 15 minutes in the morning. I knew that helped stave off depressive episodes. For the IRS bit, I could change the mailing address on file with the IRS so the paperwork would go to my accountant instead of to my UPS address. Easy peasy. Then we go to Repair. So if the worst case scenarios happen, what could you do to repair the damage even a little bit, or who could you ask for help. So in the first case, London, well, I could fork over some money, fly to Spain, get some sun, undo the damage, if I got into a funk. In the case of missing a letter from the IRS, I could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask, say, a professor of law what they would recommend, who I should talk to, how had people handled this in the past. So one question to keep in mind as youre doing this first page is. Has anyone else in the history of time less intelligent or less driven figured this out. Chances are, the answer is Yes. The second page is simple. What might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success. You can see were playing up the fears and really taking a conservative look at the upside. So if you attempted whatever youre considering, might you build confidence, develop skills, emotionally, financially, otherwise. What might be the benefits of, say, a base hit. Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this. Page three. This might be the most important, so dont skip it, The Cost of Inaction. Humans are very good at considering what might go wrong if we try something new, say, ask for a raise. What we dont often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo, not changing anything. So you should ask yourself, if I avoid this action or decision and actions and decisions like it, what might my life look like in, say, six months, 12 months, three years. Any further out, it starts to seem intangible. And really get detailed, again, emotionally, financially, physically, whatever. And when I did this, it painted a terrifying picture. I was self medicating, my business was going to implode at any moment at all times, if I didnt step away. My relationships were fraying or failing. And I realized that inaction was no longer an option for me. Those are the three pages. Thats it. Thats fear setting. And after this, I realized that on a scale of one to 10, one being minimal impact, 10 being maximal impact, if I took the trip, I was risking a one to three of temporary and reversible pain for an eight to 10 of positive, life changing impact that could be a semi permanent. So I took the trip. None of the disasters came to pass. There were some hiccups, sure. I was able to extricate myself from the business. I ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world, and that became the basis for my first book, that leads me here today. And I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear setting at least once a quarter. Its not a panacea. Youll find that some of your fears are very well founded. But you shouldnt conclude that without first putting them under a microscope. And it doesnt make all the hard times, the hard choices, easy, but it can make a lot of them easier. Id like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modern day Stoics. This is Jerzy Gregorek. He is a four time world champion in Olympic weightlifting, political refugee, published poet, 62 years old. He can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room. Hes an impressive guy. I spent a lot of time on his stoa, his porch, asking life and training advice. He was part of the Solidarity in Poland, which was a nonviolent movement for social change that was violently suppressed by the government. He lost his career as a firefighter. Then his mentor, a priest, was kidnapped, tortured, killed and thrown into a river. He was then threatened. He and his wife had to flee Poland, bounce from country to country until they landed in the US with next to nothing, sleeping on floors. He now lives in Woodside, California, in a very nice place, and of the 10,000 plus people Ive met in my life, I would put him in the top 10, in terms of success and happiness. And theres a punchline coming, so pay attention. I sent him a text a few weeks ago, asking him. Had he ever read any Stoic philosophy. And he replied with two pages of text. This is very unlike him. He is a terse dude. And not only was he familiar with stoicism, but he pointed out, for all of his most important decisions, his inflection points, when he stood up for his principles and ethics, how he had used stoicism and something akin to fear setting, which blew my mind. And he closed with two things. Number one, he couldnt imagine any life more beautiful than that of a Stoic. And the last was his mantra, which he applies to everything, and you can apply to everything, Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. The hard choices, what we most fear doing, asking, saying, these are very often exactly what we most need to do. And the biggest challenges and problems we face will never be solved with comfortable conversations, whether its in your own head or with other people. So I encourage you to ask yourselves. Where in your lives right now might defining your fears be more important than defining your goals. Keeping in mind all the while, the words of Seneca, We suffer more often in imagination than in reality. Thank you very much. "
"On the red tiles in my familys den I would dance and sing to the made for TV movie Gypsy, starring Bette Midler. I had a dream. A wonderful dream, papa. I would sing it with the urgency and the burning desire of a nine year old who did, in fact, have a dream. My dream was to be an actress. And its true that I never saw anyone who looked like me in television or in films, and sure, my family and friends and teachers all constantly warned me that people like me didnt make it in Hollywood. But I was an American. I had been taught to believe that anyone could achieve anything, regardless of the color of their skin, the fact that my parents immigrated from Honduras, the fact that I had no money. I didnt need my dream to be easy, I just needed it to be possible. And when I was 15, I got my first professional audition. It was a commercial for cable subscriptions or bail bonds, I dont really remember. What I do remember is that the casting director asked me, Could you do that again, but just this time, sound more Latina. Um, OK. So you want me to do it in Spanish. I asked. No, no, do it in English, just sound Latina. Well, I am a Latina, so isnt this what a Latina sounds like. There was a long and awkward silence, and then finally, OK, sweetie, never mind, thank you for coming in, bye. It took me most of the car ride home to realize that by sound more Latina she was asking me to speak in broken English. And I couldnt figure out why the fact that I was an actual, real life, authentic Latina didnt really seem to matter. Anyway, I didnt get the job. I didnt get a lot of the jobs people were willing to see me for, the gang bangers girlfriend, the sassy shoplifter, pregnant chola number two. These were the kinds of roles that existed for someone like me. Someone they looked at and saw as too brown, too fat, too poor, too unsophisticated. These roles were stereotypes and couldnt have been further from my own reality or from the roles I dreamt of playing. I wanted to play people who were complex and multidimensional, people who existed in the center of their own lives. Not cardboard cutouts that stood in the background of someone elses. But when I dared to say that to my manager, thats the person I pay to help me find opportunity, his response was, Someone has to tell that girl she has unrealistic expectations. And he wasnt wrong. I mean, I fired him, but he wasnt wrong. Because whenever I did try to get a role that wasnt a poorly written stereotype, I would hear, Were not looking to cast this role diversely. Or, We love her, but shes too specifically ethnic. Or, Unfortunately, we already have one Latino in this movie. I kept receiving the same message again and again and again. That my identity was an obstacle I had to overcome. And so I thought, Come at me, obstacle. Im an American. My name is America. I trained my whole life for this, Ill just follow the playbook, Ill work harder. And so I did, I worked my hardest to overcome all the things that people said were wrong with me. I stayed out of the sun so that my skin wouldnt get too brown, I straightened my curls into submission. I constantly tried to lose weight, I bought fancier and more expensive clothes. All so that when people looked at me, they wouldnt see a too fat, too brown, too poor Latina. They would see what I was capable of. And maybe they would give me a chance. And in an ironic twist of fate, when I finally did get a role that would make all my dreams come true, it was a role that required me to be exactly who I was. Ana in Real Women Have Curves was a brown, poor, fat Latina. I had never seen anyone like her, anyone like me, existing in the center of her own life story. I traveled throughout the US and to multiple countries with this film where people, regardless of their age, ethnicity, body type, saw themselves in Ana. A 17 year old chubby Mexican American girl struggling against cultural norms to fulfill her unlikely dream. In spite of what I had been told my whole life, I saw firsthand that people actually did want to see stories about people like me. And that my unrealistic expectations to see myself authentically represented in the culture were other peoples expectations, too. Real Women Have Curves was a critical, cultural and financial success. Great, I thought, We did it. We proved our stories have value. Things are going to change now. But I watched as very little happened. There was no watershed. No one in the industry was rushing to tell more stories about the audience that was hungry and willing to pay to see them. Four years later, when I got to play Ugly Betty, I saw the same phenomenon play out. Ugly Betty premiered in the US to 16 million viewers and was nominated for 11 Emmys in its first year. But in spite of Ugly Bettys success, there would not be another television show led by a Latina actress on American television for eight years. Its been 12 years since I became the first and only Latina to ever win an Emmy in a lead category. That is not a point of pride. That is a point of deep frustration. Not because awards prove our worth, but because who we see thriving in the world teaches us how to see ourselves, how to think about our own value, how to dream about our futures. And anytime I begin to doubt that, I remember that there was a little girl, living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. And somehow, she got her hands on some DVDs of an American television show in which she saw her own dream of becoming a writer reflected. In her autobiography, Malala wrote, I had become interested in journalism after seeing how my own words could make a difference and also from watching the Ugly Betty DVDs about life at an American magazine. For 17 years of my career, I have witnessed the power our voices have when they can access presence in the culture. Ive seen it. Ive lived it, weve all seen it. In entertainment, in politics, in business, in social change. We cannot deny it, presence creates possibility. But for the last 17 years, Ive also heard the same excuses for why some of us can access presence in the culture and some of us cant. Our stories dont have an audience, our experiences wont resonate in the mainstream, our voices are too big a financial risk. Just a few years ago, my agent called to explain to me why I wasnt getting a role in a movie. He said, They loved you and they really, really do want to cast diversely, but the movie isnt financeable until they cast the white role first. He delivered the message with a broken heart and with a tone that communicated, I understand how messed up this is. But nonetheless, just like hundreds of times before, I felt the tears roll down my face. And the pang of rejection rise up in me and then the voice of shame scolding me, You are a grown woman, stop crying over a job. I went through this process for years of accepting the failure as my own and then feeling deep shame that I couldnt overcome the obstacles. But this time, I heard a new voice. A voice that said, Im tired. Ive had enough. A voice that understood my tears and my pain were not about losing a job. They were about what was actually being said about me. What had been said about me my whole life by executives and producers and directors and writers and agents and managers and teachers and friends and family. That I was a person of less value. I thought sunscreen and straightening irons would bring about change in this deeply entrenched value system. But what I realized in that moment was that I was never actually asking the system to change. I was asking it to let me in, and those arent the same thing. I couldnt change what a system believed about me, while I believed what the system believed about me. And I did. I, like everyone around me, believed that it wasnt possible for me to exist in my dream as I was. And I went about trying to make myself invisible. What this revealed to me was that it is possible to be the person who genuinely wants to see change while also being the person whose actions keep things the way they are. And what its led me to believe is that change isnt going to come by identifying the good guys and the bad guys. That conversation lets us all off the hook. Because most of us are neither one of those. Change will come when each of us has the courage to question our own fundamental values and beliefs. And then see to it that our actions lead to our best intentions. I am just one of millions of people who have been told that in order to fulfill my dreams, in order to contribute my talents to the world I have to resist the truth of who I am. I for one, am ready to stop resisting and to start existing as my full and authentic self. If I could go back and say anything to that nine year old, dancing in the den, dreaming her dreams, I would say, my identity is not my obstacle. My identity is my superpower. Because the truth is, I am what the world looks like. You are what the world looks like. Collectively, we are what the world actually looks like. And in order for our systems to reflect that, they dont have to create a new reality. They just have to stop resisting the one we already live in. Thank you. "
"The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone. Theyve changed the world. However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what weve been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world. Weve heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6. Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world. And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined. And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And its a pretty big building. How big. Well, I can give you the numbers, 140,000 square meters, but that doesnt really tell you very much. Maybe its better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store youve ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store. Right. Its pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone. Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesnt sound too bad until you realize that Im a foreigner and youre a foreigner. In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners. Right. So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet. But dont get me wrong. There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or theyre trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then its perfectly fine for them to tap the suspects phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. Im not arguing that at all, but thats not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. Theyre about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent. So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, theres nothing new here. And thats not true. Dont let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didnt know this was happening. Now we know for a fact its happening. We didnt know about this. We didnt know about PRISM. We didnt know about XKeyscore. We didnt know about Cybertrans. We didnt know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter, all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do. And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, its going to take millions of years. So thats basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. A real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do, do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic. Thats what theyre trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, theyre trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control. So what do we actually know about the leaks. Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others. Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on. And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isnt true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation. And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating. Instead, theyve been hacked. That would explain it. They arent cooperating. Theyve been hacked. In this case, theyve been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government. And theres more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, its called NAC, Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. countrys intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual. Heres the primary target, heres the secondary target, heres the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, Success, when they gain access to services like this. What the hell. And then theres the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe thats true. Many countries spy, not all of them, but lets take an example. Lets take, for example, Sweden. Im speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S. based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support. And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services. And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. Its not balanced by any means, not even close. And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States. Like, Skype used to be secure. It used to be end to end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today, it no longer is secure. So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome. And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. Its the war on terror. You shouldnt worry about it. Well, its not the war on terror. Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I dont think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right. Its not the war on terror. Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them. Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists. And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom. Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all. But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasnt thought about this long enough. Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure thats the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you cant keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. Im not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when youve been using search engines, youve been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this. What am I sending to worry about this. Am I sending naked pictures or something. And my answer to Kimberly was that what Im sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your governments business either. Because thats what its about. Its about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use. And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history, and Ill find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States. And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy. Thats what its about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters. So Mr. Snowden, hes been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations, and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming. So, what is there to be done. Should we worry. No, we shouldnt worry. We should be angry, because this is wrong, and its rude, and it should not be done. But thats not going to really change the situation. Whats going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And thats much easier said than done. How do you do that. A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S. made operating systems and cloud services. But maybe you dont have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesnt have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. Thank you very much. "
"I was thinking about my place in the universe, and about my first thought about what infinity might mean, when I was a child. And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesnt that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. So we dont really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line. But nothing else does either. Therefore every moment really is the most important moment thats ever happened, including this moment right now. And so therefore this music youre about to hear is maybe the most important music youll ever hear in your life. Thank you. For those of you who Ill be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying, Oh my god, youre so much shorter in real life. Because its like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason. Somewhat like the curving of the universe. I dont know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot, My god, youre guitars are so gigantic. You must get them custom made, special, humongous guitars. Thank you very much. "
"Well, I was introduced as the former Governor of Michigan, but actually Im a scientist. All right, a political scientist, it doesnt really count, but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist, I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. But there were three problems, three enigmas that I could not solve, and I want to share with you those problems, but most importantly, I think I figured out a proposal for a solution. The first problem that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is, how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy. So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab. I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003, I got a call from one of my staff members, who said, Gov, we have a big problem. We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan, population 8,000, and they are about to lose their major employer, which is a refrigerator factory thats operated by Electrolux. And I said, Well, how many people work at Electrolux. And he said, 3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville. So it is a one company town. And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico. So I said, Forget that. Im the new Governor. We can fix this. Were going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they cant refuse. So I brought my whole cabinet, and we met with all of the pooh bahs of little Greenville, the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college, and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table, incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay, and as we made our pile of chips, we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux. And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years, or that wed help to build a new factory for the company, wed help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers, said they would offer unprecedented concessions, sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. So the management of Electrolux took our pile, our list of incentives, and they went outside the room for 17 minutes, and they came back in and they said, Wow, this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here. But theres nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay USD 1.57 an hour in Juarez, Mexico. So were leaving. And they did. And when they did, it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville. In fact, they did implode the factory. Thats a guy that is walking on his last day of work. And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line, the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan, had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper. It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion, and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor that I couldnt stop the outflow of these jobs, and I wanted to grieve with them, and as I went into the room, theres thousands of people there. It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music, or a band playing sad music, probably both. And this guy comes up to me, and hes got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on, and he had his two daughters with him, and he said, Gov, these are my two daughters. He said, Im 48 years old, and I have worked at this factory for 30 years. I went from high school to factory. My father worked at this factory, he said. My grandfather worked at this factory. All I know is how to make refrigerators. And he looked at his daughters, and he puts his hand on his chest, and he says, So, Gov, tell me, who is ever going to hire me. Who is ever going to hire me. And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion, and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories that closed in the first decade of this century. Enigma number one. How do you create jobs in America in a global economy. Number two, very quickly. How do you solve global climate change when we dont even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm. In fact, there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared Congresss approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things, and it was found, in fact, that Congresss approval rating is worse than cockroaches, lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. But wait, the good news is its at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea. We got a problem, folks. So it got me thinking, what is it. What in the laboratory that I see out there, the laboratories of democracy, what has happened. What policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way. So if I asked you, for example, what was the Obama Administration policy that caused massive changes across the country, what would you say. You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes. As we know, only half the states have opted in. We might say the Recovery Act, but those didnt require policy changes. The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education. Why. The government put a USD 4.5 billion pot and said to the governors across the country, compete for it. Forty eight governors competed, convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum. Forty eight states opted in, creating a national education policy from the bottom up. So I thought, well, why cant we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top. Because after all, if you look at the context, 1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally, and every dollar represents a job, and where are those jobs going. Well, theyre going to places that have policy, like China. In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing, and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that I was with, and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the Chinese officials, and we were watching, and he says, So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy. And I said, Oh my God, Congress, gridlock, who knows. And this is what he did, he goes, he says, Take your time. Because they see our passivity as their opportunity. So what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country, and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion, which sounds like a lot, but actually its less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending. Its a rounding error on the federal side. But price to entry into that competition would be, you could just, say, use the Presidents goal. He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard of 80 percent by 2030, in other words, that youd have to get 80 percent of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030. Why not ask all of the states to do that instead. And imagine what might happen, because every region has something to offer. You might take states like Iowa and Ohio, two very important political states, by the way, those two governors, and they would say, were going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy. You might say the solar states, the sun belt, were going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country, and maybe Jerry Brown says, Well, Im going to create an industry cluster in California to be able to produce the solar panels so that were not buying them from China but were buying them from the U.S. In fact, every region of the country could do this. You see, youve got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation. In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states in the West, they could do geothermal, or you could look at Texas and say, we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid. In the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agricultural waste, they might say, were going to lead the nation in biofuels. In the upper northeast, were going to lead the nation in energy efficiency solutions. Along the eastern seaboard, were going to lead the nation in offshore wind. You might look at Michigan and say, were going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery. Every region has something to offer, and if you created a competition, it respects the states and it respects federalism. Its opt in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina, who didnt opt into the education Race to the Top, you might even get them to opt in. Why. Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons. We want to bring jobs. Im just saying. And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy. Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say, Okay, great idea, but really. Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table. They cant agree to anything. So you could wait and go through Congress, although you should be very impatient. Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress. Go around Congress. What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors. What if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at TED decided that they would create, band together, just a couple of them, and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors respond. What if it all started here at TED. What if you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in America, , and get national energy policy and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up. Because, dear TEDsters, if you are impatient like I am, you know that our economic competitors, our other nations, are in the game and are eating us for lunch. And we can get in the game or not. We can be at the table or we can be on the table. And I dont know about you, but I prefer to dine. Thank you all so much. "
"In his inaugural address, Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis. But what did he appeal to. He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, and tell us to just go shopping. Nor did he tell us, Trust us. Trust your country. Invest, invest, invest. Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things. And he appealed to virtue. Virtue is an old fashioned word. It seems a little out of place in a cutting edge environment like this one. And besides, some of you might be wondering, what the hell does it mean. Let me begin with an example. This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen. And all of the items on it are unremarkable. Theyre the things you would expect, mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets. It may be a little surprising how many things there are, but its not surprising what they are. But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this, even though this is a very long list, there isnt a single thing on it that involves other human beings. Not one. The janitors job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital. And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like, they encountered Mike, who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise, trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall. And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisors admonition and didnt vacuum the visitors lounge because there were some family members who were there all day, every day who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap. And then there was Luke, who washed the floor in a comatose young mans room twice because the mans father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months, didnt see Luke do it the first time, and his father was angry. And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses and, if were lucky now and then, from doctors, doesnt just make people feel a little better, it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well. Now, not all janitors are like this, of course. But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness, care and empathy are an essential part of the job. And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings. These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people. And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means. Practical wisdom, Aristotle told us, is the combination of moral will and moral skill. A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule, as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives. A wise person knows how to improvise, as Luke did when he rewashed the floor. Real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing. A wise person is like a jazz musician, using the notes on the page, but dancing around them, inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand. A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims. To serve other people, not to manipulate other people. And finally, perhaps most important, a wise person is made, not born. Wisdom depends on experience, and not just any experience. You need the time to get to know the people that youre serving. You need permission to be allowed to improvise, try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures. And you need to be mentored by wise teachers. When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience. And they dont mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans. It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people. At TED, brilliance is rampant. Its scary. The good news is you dont need to be brilliant to be wise. The bad news is that without wisdom, brilliance isnt enough. Its as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else. Now, I hope that we all know this. Theres a sense in which its obvious, and yet, let me tell you a little story. Its a story about lemonade. A dad and his seven year old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark. His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it. All they had was Mikes Hard Lemonade, which was five percent alcohol. Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mikes Hard Lemonade contained alcohol. So he brought it back. And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it, and called the police, who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital. The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood. And they were ready to let the kid go. But not so fast. The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no. And the child was sent to a foster home for three days. At that point, can the child go home. Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel. After two weeks, Im happy to report, the family was reunited. But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing, We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure. How do things like this happen. Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR, said, Rules and procedures may be dumb, but they spare you from thinking. And, to be fair, rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household. Fair enough. When things go wrong, as of course they do, we reach for two tools to try to fix them. One tool we reach for is rules. Better ones, more of them. The second tool we reach for is incentives. Better ones, more of them. What else, after all, is there. We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis. Regulate, regulate, regulate. Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ... The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job. How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did. And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic. Its preposterous on its face. And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules, rules and incentives may make things better in the short run, but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run. Moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations. And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing. And without intending it, by appealing to rules and incentives, we are engaging in a war on wisdom. Let me just give you a few examples, first of rules and the war on moral skill. The lemonade story is one. Second, no doubt more familiar to you, is the nature of modern American education, scripted, lock step curricula. Heres an example from Chicago kindergarten. Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with B. Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water. Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book. All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city, every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day. We know why these scripts are there. We dont trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own. Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster. And they prevent disaster. But what they assure in its place is mediocrity. Dont get me wrong. We need rules. Jazz musicians need some notes, most of them need some notes on the page. We need more rules for the bankers, God knows. But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising. And as a result, they lose their gifts, or worse, they stop playing altogether. Now, how about incentives. They seem cleverer. If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and youre more likely to do it. Right. Well, not always. Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting, and they make people less likely to do it. Ill just give you one example because time is racing. In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago, they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps. There was going to be a national referendum. Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed. And they said, Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community. Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes. They knew it was dangerous. They thought it would reduce their property values. But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens. The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question. They said, If we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community. Two reasons. Its my responsibility and Im getting paid. Instead of 50 percent saying yes, 25 percent said yes. What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking, What is my responsibility. all we ask is, What serves my interests. When incentives dont work, when CEOs ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses, the response is always the same. Get smarter incentives. The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough. Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will. We need incentives. People have to make a living. But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word. It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality. Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated, We must ask not just Is it profitable. but Is it right. And when professions are demoralized, everyone in them becomes dependent on, addicted to, incentives and they stop asking Is it right. We see this in medicine. And we certainly see it in the world of business. It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work. So what can we do. A few sources of hope, we ought to try to remoralize work. One way not to do it, teach more ethics courses. There is no better way to show people that youre not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course. What to do instead. One. Celebrate moral exemplars. Acknowledge, when you go to law school, that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch. No 10 year old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions. People are inspired by moral heroes. But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you cant acknowledge that you have moral heroes. Well, acknowledge them. Be proud that you have them. Celebrate them. And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too. Thats one thing we can do. I dont know how many of you remember this, another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein, who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts, they made Polartec, The factory burned down. 3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll. Why. Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go. Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street, but I can tell you its worth more. Were doing fine. Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes. Two were particularly inspiring to me. One was Ray Anderson, who turned, , turned, you know, a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint, or almost zero footprint business. Why. Because it was the right thing to do. And a bonus hes discovering is hes actually going to make even more money. His employees are inspired by the effort. Why. Because there happy to be doing something thats the right thing to do. Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about reforesting in Indonesia. In many ways this is the perfect example. Because it took the will to do the right thing. God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill. Im boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out. But most important to make it work, and he emphasized this, is that it took knowing the people in the communities. Unless the people youre working with are behind you, this will fail. And there isnt a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you, because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways. So theres a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate. And you dont have to be a mega hero. There are ordinary heroes. Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too. As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes. As heads of organizations, we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will. Even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work. If you run an organization, you should be sure that none of the jobs, none of the jobs, have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors. Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work. And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom. And, perhaps most important, as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes, the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor. And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers. One is that we are always teaching. Someone is always watching. The camera is always on. Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing, Knowledge is power. And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college. I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didnt mention. That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character. They need to learn to respect themselves. They need to learn to respect their schoolmates. They need to learn to respect their teachers. And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning. Thats the principle objective. If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill. And the teachers, the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day. Obama appealed to virtue. And I think he was right. And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom, because its what allows other virtues, honesty, kindness, courage and so on, to be displayed at the right time and in the right way. He also appealed to hope. Right again. I think there is reason for hope. I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous. In many ways, its what TED is all about. Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons. This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention. Paying attention to what we do, to how we do it, and, perhaps most importantly, to the structure of the organizations within which we work, so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed. Thank you very much. Thank you. You have to go and stand out here a sec. Thank you very much. "
"So over the past few centuries, microscopes have revolutionized our world. They revealed to us a tiny world of objects, life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes. They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology. Today Id like to introduce you to a new type of microscope, a microscope for changes. It doesnt use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger, but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people, changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes. And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way. So what do I mean by color changes. Our skin, for example, changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it. That change is incredibly subtle, which is why, when you look at other people, when you look at the person sitting next to you, you dont see their skin or their face changing color. When we look at this video of Steve here, it appears to us like a static picture, but once we look at this video through our new, special microscope, suddenly we see a completely different image. What you see here are small changes in the color of Steves skin, magnified 100 times so that they become visible. We can actually see a human pulse. We can see how fast Steves heart is beating, but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face. And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse, but also to actually recover our heart rates, and measure our heart rates. And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients. So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera, and the heart rate measurement we get is as accurate as the one youd get with a standard monitor in a hospital. And it doesnt even have to be a video we recorded. We can do it essentially with other videos as well. So I just took a short clip from Batman Begins here just to show Christian Bales pulse. And you know, presumably hes wearing makeup, the lighting here is kind of challenging, but still, just from the video, were able to extract his pulse and show it quite well. So how do we do all that. We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time, and then we crank up those changes. We make them bigger so that we can see them. The tricky part is that those signals, those changes that were after, are extremely subtle, so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them from noise that always exists in videos. So we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video, and then the way the color changes over time, and then we amplify those changes. We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos, or magnified videos, that actually show us those changes. But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color, but also tiny motions, and thats because the light that gets recorded in our cameras will change not only if the color of the object changes, but also if the object moves. So this is my daughter when she was about two months old. Its a video I recorded about three years ago. And as new parents, we all want to make sure our babies are healthy, that theyre breathing, that theyre alive, of course. So I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep. And this is pretty much what youll see with a standard baby monitor. You can see the babys sleeping, but theres not too much information there. Theres not too much we can see. Wouldnt it be better, or more informative, or more useful, if instead we could look at the view like this. So here I took the motions and I magnified them 30 times, and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing. Here is a side by side comparison. So again, in the source video, in the original video, theres not too much we can see, but once we magnify the motions, the breathing becomes much more visible. And it turns out, theres a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope. We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies. We can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion. And thats actually my eye, and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born, so you can see I wasnt getting too much sleep. Even when a person is sitting still, theres a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns, small facial expressions. Maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions. We can also magnify small mechanical movements, like vibrations in engines, that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems, or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces. Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways, but measuring those motions is one thing, and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole different thing. And ever since we discovered this new technology, we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it. Its very simple to use. It can work on your own videos. Our collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website where you can upload your videos and process them online, so even if you dont have any experience in computer science or programming, you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope. And Id like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it. So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85. I dont know who that user is, but he, or she, used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy. Its kind of creepy. People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands. And you know its not real science unless you use guinea pigs, and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany, and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion magnified. You can also do some art with it. So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale. She wanted to see if theres any difference in the way her classmates move. She made them all stand still, and then magnified their motions. Its like seeing still pictures come to life. And the nice thing with all those examples is that we had nothing to do with them. We just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world, and then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it. But we didnt stop there. This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way, it also redefines what we can do and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras. So as scientists, we started wondering, what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure. And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound. Sound, as we all know, is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air. Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them, which is how we hear and how we record sound. But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions. Those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing. So here are two examples. This is me demonstrating my great singing skills. And I took a high speed video of my throat while I was humming. Again, if you stare at that video, theres not too much youll be able to see, but once we magnify the motions 100 times, we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound. That signal is there in that video. We also know that singers can break a wine glass if they hit the correct note. So here, were going to play a note thats in the resonance frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker thats next to it. Once we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times, we can very clearly see how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound. Its not something youre used to seeing every day. But this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea. Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects, and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them. In this way, we can turn everyday objects into microphones. So thats exactly what we did. So heres an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table, and were going to turn that bag of chips into a microphone by filming it with a video camera and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it. So heres the sound that we played in the room. And this is a high speed video we recorded of that bag of chips. Again its playing. Theres no chance youll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it, but heres the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that video. I call it, Thank you. I call it the visual microphone. We actually extract audio signals from video signals. And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here, a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer. Thats one thousandth of a millimeter. Thats how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras. We can recover sounds from other objects, like plants. And we can recover speech as well. So heres a person speaking in a room. Voice. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go. And heres that speech again recovered just from this video of that same bag of chips. Voice. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go. We used Mary Had a Little Lamb because those are said to be the first words that Thomas Edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877. It was one of the first sound recording devices in history. It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder. Heres a demonstration of recording and replaying sound with Edisons phonograph. Voice. Testing, testing, one two three. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. Testing, testing, one two three. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. And now, 137 years later, were able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras, and we can even do that when the camera is 15 feet away from the object, behind soundproof glass. So this is the sound that we were able to recover in that case. Voice. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. And of course, surveillance is the first application that comes to mind. But it might actually be useful for other things as well. Maybe in the future, well be able to use it, for example, to recover sound across space, because sound cant travel in space, but light can. Weve only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology. It lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that weve never been able to see with our own eyes until now. This is our team. Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here, and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website, try it out yourself, and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions. Thank you. "
"Five hundred seventy one million two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels are used by Americans every year. If we could, correction, wrong figure, 13 billion used every year. If we could reduce the usage of paper towels, one paper towel per person per day, 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used. We can do that. Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers. Theres the tri fold. People typically take two or three. Theres the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off. People go one, two, three, four, tear. This much, right. Theres the one that cuts itself. People go, one, two, three, four. Or theres the same thing, but recycled paper, you have to get five of those because theyre not as absorbent, of course. The fact is, you can do it all with one towel. The key, two words. This half of the room, your word is shake. Lets hear it. Shake. Louder. Audience. Shake. Your word is fold. Audience. Fold. Again. Audience. Fold. Really loud. Audience. Shake. Fold. OK. Wet hands. Shake, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Why 12.

"A little over 100 years ago, in 1915, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which is sort of a strange name, but its a theory that explains gravity. It states that mass, all matter, the planets, attracts mass, not because of an instantaneous force, as Newton claimed, but because all matter, all of us, all the planets, wrinkles the flexible fabric of space time. Space time is this thing in which we live and that connects us all. Its like when we lie down on a mattress and distort its contour. The masses move, again, not according to Newtons laws, but because they see this space time curvature and follow the little curves, just like when our bedmate nestles up to us because of the mattress curvature. A year later, in 1916, Einstein derived from his theory that gravitational waves existed, and that these waves were produced when masses move, like, for example, when two stars revolve around one another and create folds in space time which carry energy from the system, and the stars move toward each other. However, he also estimated that these effects were so minute, that it would never be possible to measure them. Im going to tell you the story of how, with the work of hundreds of scientists working in many countries over the course of many decades, just recently, in 2015, we discovered those gravitational waves for the first time. Its a rather long story. It started 1.3 billion years ago. A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, two black holes were revolving around one another, dancing the tango, I like to say. It started slowly, but as they emitted gravitational waves, they grew closer together, accelerating in speed, until, when they were revolving at almost the speed of light, they fused into a single black hole that had 60 times the mass of the Sun, but compressed into the space of 360 kilometers. Thats the size of the state of Louisiana, where I live. This incredible effect produced gravitational waves that carried the news of this cosmic hug to the rest of the universe. It took us a long time to figure out the effects of these gravitational waves, because the way we measure them is by looking for effects in distances. We want to measure longitudes, distances. When these gravitational waves passed by Earth, which was in 2015, they produced changes in all distances, the distances between all of you, the distances between you and me, our heights, every one of us stretched and shrank a tiny bit. The prediction is that the effect is proportional to the distance. But its very small, even for distances much greater than my slight height, the effect is infinitesimal. For example, the distance between the Earth and the Sun changed by one atomic diameter. How can that be measured. How could we measure it. Fifty years ago, some visionary physicists at Caltech and MIT, Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss, thought they could precisely measure distances using lasers that measured distances between mirrors kilometers apart. It took many years, a lot of work and many scientists to develop the technology and develop the ideas. And 20 years later, almost 30 years ago, they started to build two gravitational wave detectors, two interferometers, in the United States. Each one is four kilometers long, one is in Livingston, Louisiana, in the middle of a beautiful forest, and the other is in Hanford, Washington, in the middle of the desert. The interferometers have lasers that travel from the center through four kilometers in vacuum, are reflected in mirrors and then they return. We measure the difference in the distances between this arm and this arm. These detectors are very, very, very sensitive, theyre the most precise instruments in the world. Why did we make two. Its because the signals that we want to measure come from space, but the mirrors are moving all the time, so in order to distinguish the gravitational wave effects, which are astrophysical effects and should show up on the two detectors, we can distinguish them from the local effects, which appear separately, either on one or the other. In September of 2015, we were finishing installing the second generation technology in the detectors, and we still werent at the optimal sensitivity that we wanted, were still not, even now, two years later, but we wanted to gather data. We didnt think wed see anything, but we were getting ready to start collecting a few months worth of data. And then nature surprised us. On September 14, 2015, we saw, in both detectors, a gravitational wave. In both detectors, we saw a signal with cycles that increased in amplitude and frequency and then go back down. And they were the same in both detectors. They were gravitational waves. And not only that, in decoding this type of wave, we were able to deduce that they came from black holes fusing together to make one, more than a billion years ago. And that was, that was fantastic. At first, we couldnt believe it. We didnt imagine this would happen until much later, it was a surprise for all of us. It took us months to convince ourselves that it was true, because we didnt want to leave any room for error. But it was true, and to clear up any doubt that the detectors really could measure these things, in December of that same year, we measured another gravitational wave, smaller than the first one. The first gravitational wave produced a difference in the distance of four thousandths of a proton over four kilometers. Yes, the second detection was smaller, but still very convincing by our standards. Despite the fact that these are space time waves and not sound waves, we like to put them into loudspeakers and listen to them. We call this the music of the universe. Id like you to listen to the first two notes of that music. The second, shorter sound was the last fraction of a second of the two black holes which, in that fraction of a second, emitted vast amounts of energy, so much energy, it was like three Suns converting into energy, following that famous formula, E equals mc2. Remember that one. We love this music so much we actually dance to it. Im going to have you listen again. Its the music of the universe. People frequently ask me now, What can gravitational waves be used for. And now that youve discovered them, what else is there left to do. What can gravitational waves be used for. When they asked Borges, What is the purpose of poetry. he, in turn, answered, Whats the purpose of dawn. Whats the purpose of caresses. Whats the purpose of the smell of coffee. He answered, The purpose of poetry is pleasure, its for emotion, its for living. And understanding the universe, this human curiosity for knowing how everything works, is similar. Since time immemorial, humanity, all of us, everyone, as kids, when we look up at the sky for the first time and see the stars, we wonder, What are stars. That curiosity is what makes us human. And thats what we do with science. We like to say that gravitational waves now have a purpose, because were opening up a new way to explore the universe. Until now, we were able to see the light of the stars via electromagnetic waves. Now we can listen to the sound of the universe, even of things that dont emit light, like gravitational waves. Thank you. But are they useful. Cant we derive any technology from gravitational waves. Yes, probably. But it will probably take a lot of time. Weve developed the technology to detect them, but in terms of the waves themselves, maybe well discover 100 years from now that they are useful. But it takes a lot of time to derive technology from science, and thats not why we do it. All technology is derived from science, but we practice science for the enjoyment. Whats left to do. A lot. A lot, this is only the beginning. As we make the detectors more and more sensitive, and we have lots of work to do there, not only are we going to see more black holes and be able to catalog how many there are, where they are and how big they are, well also be able to see other objects. Well see neutron stars fuse and turn into black holes. Well see a black holes being born. Well be able to see rotating stars in our galaxy produce sinusoidal waves. Well be able to see explosions of supernovas in our galaxy. Well be seeing a whole spectrum of new sources. We like to say that weve added a new sense to the human body, now, in addition to seeing, were able to hear. This is a revolution in astronomy, like when Galileo invented the telescope. Its like when they added sound to silent movies. This is just the beginning. We like to think that the road to science is very long, very fun, but very long, and that we, this large, international community of scientists, working from many countries, together as a team, are helping to build that road, that were shedding light, sometimes encountering detours, and building, perhaps, a highway to the universe. Thank you. "
"This is a sculpture I made, which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom. So, it can balance on a point. This is a bronze ball, an aluminum arm here, and then this wooden disk. And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that youd want to hold on to, and that would glide easily through your hands. The aluminum is because its very light. The bronze is nice hard, durable material that could roll on the ground. Inside of the bronze ball theres a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle thats on two bearings that pass in between, across it, like this, that counterbalance this weight. So it allows it to roll. And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction. But if you put something on top of it, it disbalances it. And so it would tip over. But in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point. And then there was a second level to this object, which is that it, I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in, which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other. I was exploring, really early on, wanting to make things float in the air. And I thought up a lot of ideas. This is sculpture that I made that, its magnetically levitated. The thing is, is that its slightly dangerous. Normally its sort of cordoned off when its in a museum. But its uh, lets see if I can manipulate it a little bit without, um, oops. So this is just floating, floating on a permanent magnetic field, which stabilizes it in all directions. Except there is a slight tether here, which keeps it from going over the top of its field. Its sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave. And thats what supports the object and keeps it stable. I think we could roll the tape, admin. I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations, which I could narrate. This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth, in proportion. Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two. So here is the Earth. Its a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze. And here is a similar sculpture. Thats the Sun at that end. And then in a series of 55 balls, it reduces, proportionately, each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately, until they get down to this little Earth. This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also. This is a little stone ball, floating. As you can see the little tether, that its also magnetically levitated. And then this is the first part of, this is 109 spheres, since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth. And so this is the size of the Sun. And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun. Its made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres. This is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist. I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. So this, again, is on the subject, a slice from the equator of the Earth. And then the Moon in the center, and its floating. And this is in France. This is in Sapporo. Its balancing on a shaft and a ball, right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty. So you can see it rotating here. It weighs about a ton or over a ton. Its made of stainless steel, quite thick. But its being balanced like that in equilibrium. Its susceptible to motion by the air currents. This is another species of work that I do. These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended, but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. So all the red sides, for example, face one direction, south. And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way. So as you turn around youre seeing different colors. This is based on the structure of a diamond. It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure. And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms. And so I placed one more element of each one of them. These were white spheres. Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres. So they would catch parts of the images, and make sort of three dimensional color volumes, as you walk through it, through the object. This is something I did of a tactile communication system. It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture, and then putting it into a communication system. This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball, that would be directed around the room by a computer. This is a clock I designed. It has Buckminster Fullers Dymaxion Map edited here. It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. And then, this is like projects that are harder to build. This has a diamond bottomed lake. So its a floating island with water, fresh water, that can fly from place to place. This would be grown, I suppose, with nanotechnology in the future sometime. In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests. And some of it is just the idea of creating media, media as a sculpture, something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing, by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of. And I had a lot of, always interested in the concept of a crystal ball. And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future, or a television set, where its sort of like a magic box where anything can appear. I had thought about, a long time ago, in the late 60s, when I was just starting out, I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fullers grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations, and other things that were happening, the space program at that time, and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that. I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. So if we could roll the next film here. This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations. But this the current version of it, is a flying airship that is about 35 meters in diameter, about 110 feet in diameter. The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes, red, blue, and green, that allow you to have a high resolution picture, visible in daylight. I came with a plan. I brought it to Paul MacCreadys company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study, and they analyzed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen. This is the control room inside of the ship. The idea of this air genie is, its something that can just transform and become anything. Its like a traveling show. It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it. So it can see its environment, and then it can mimic its environment and disappear. Here the legs are retracting. The cabin is open or closed, as you like. It weighs about 20 tons. It has on board generators. It can generate about a million kilowatts, in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight. The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show. It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting. There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians, that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment, and to interact as an entity that was aware, that could communicate. Its completely silent and nonpolluting. It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with, say, going to a college campus, and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences, the world, the situation of the globe. The default image on the object would probably be a high resolution Earth image. But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations, all of the things that were concerned with today. And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation, where the people could cut loose, and the music and the lights, and everything. So it could land in a park, for example. Or this could represent a college green. And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this. And so interacting with the same kind of imagery. It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it. It would be forum for peoples ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type. So thats pretty much it. Okay. Thank you. "
"Humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors, where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye, microorganisms. Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us, and some that are bad for us. What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors. Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems. And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures. The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans, and with the human built environment. And today, architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us. We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments, like this building here, environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering, heating and air conditioning. Given the amount of time that we spend indoors, its important to understand how this affects our health. At the Biology and the Built Environment Center, we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air. And we looked at three different types of rooms. We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated, which are the data points in the blue. We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated, where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable, but they made them operable for our study. And we also sampled the outdoor air. If you look at the x axis of this graph, youll see that what we commonly want to do, which is keeping the outdoors out, we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation. So if you look at the green data points, which is air thats outside, youll see that theres a large amount of microbial diversity, or variety of microbial types. But if you look at the blue data points, which is mechanically ventilated air, its not as diverse. But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health. If you look at the y axis of this graph, youll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air, you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen, or germ, than if youre outdoors. So to understand why this was the case, we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram, which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples. The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart. And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, theyre not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air. What weve found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans. It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit. And this is because were all constantly shedding microbes. So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another. And when youre outdoors, that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt. Why does this matter. It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States. Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings. And the model that were working with in hospitals, and also with many, many different buildings, is to keep the outdoors out. And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health. And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections, or hospital acquired infections, this is a clue that its a good time to reconsider our current practices. So just as we manage national parks, where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others, were working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors. Ive heard somebody say that youre as healthy as your gut. And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora. And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside. Thank you. "
"Right when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy. My family had moved from Fort Lee, New Jersey to California, from the snow to lots of heat, and gas lines. There was gas rationing in 1973. The energy crisis was in full bore. I started reading Popular Science magazine, and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis. I had just taken trigonometry in high school, I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus. That got me very excited. And I really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light. So, I started this company called Solar Devices. And this was a company where I built parabolas, I took metal shop, and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines. And I was building a Stirling engine over on the lathe, and all the motorcycle guys said, Youre building a bong, arent you. And I said, No, its a Stirling engine. But they didnt believe me. I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine, for four dollars each. And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech. It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech. And at my first year at Caltech, I continued the business. But then, in the second year of Caltech, they started grading. The whole first year was pass fail, but the second year was graded. I wasnt able to keep up with the business, and I ended up with a 25 year detour. My dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost, but then I had this big detour. First, the coursework at Caltech. Then, when I graduated from Caltech, the IBM PC came out, and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981. And then in 1983, Lotus 1 2 3 came out, and I was completely blown away by Lotus 1 2 3. I began operating my business with 1 2 3, began writing add ins for 1 2 3, wrote a natural language interface to 1 2 3. I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus, and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession. Much later, in 2000, very recently, the new California energy crisis, what was purported to be a big energy crisis, was coming. And I was trying to figure out if we could build something that would capitalize on that and get people backup energy, in case the crisis really came. And I started looking at how we could build battery backup systems that could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day, or three days worth of backup power. Im glad you heard earlier today, batteries are unbelievably, lack density compared to fuel. So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries. Youd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery backup. And I concluded, after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy, flywheels, different formulations of batteries, it just wasnt practical to store energy. So what about making energy. Maybe we could make energy. I tried to figure out, maybe solars become attractive. Its been 25 years since I was doing this, let me go back and look at whats been happening with solar cells. And the price had gone down from 10 dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt, but it stabilized. And it needed to get much lower to be cost effective. I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells, and was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively. A lot of new things are happening to do that, but fundamentally, the process requires a tremendous amount of energy. Some people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life. If we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells, that will become more practical. But right now, you pretty much have to take silicon, put it in an oven at 1600 F for 17 hours, to make the cells. A lot of people are working to try and reduce that, but I didnt have anything to contribute. So I tried to figure out what other way could we try to make cost effective solar electricity. What if we collect the sun with a large reflector, like I had been thinking about in high school, but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper, concentrate it to a small converter, and then the conversion device wouldnt have to be as expensive, because its much smaller, rather than solar cells, which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from. This seemed practical now, because a lot of new technologies had come in the 25 years since I had last looked at it. There was a lot of new manufacturing techniques, not to mention really cheap miniature motors, brushless motors, servomotors, stepper motors, that are used in printers and scanners. So, thats a breakthrough. Of course, inexpensive microprocessors and a very important breakthrough, genetic algorithms. Ill be very short on genetic algorithms. Its a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection. You take a problem that you cant solve with a pure mathematical answer, you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing, you add sex, where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations, and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions. Usually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today, with a three gigahertz processor, you can solve many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes. So we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator. And Ill show you what we came up with. Traditionally, concentrators look like this. Those shapes are parabolas. They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot. They have to track the sun, because they have to point directly at the sun. They usually have a one degree acceptance angle, once theyre more than a degree off, none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus. So we tried to come up with a non tracking collector that would gather much more than one degree of light, with no moving parts. So we created a genetic algorithm to try this out, we made a model in Excel of a multisurface reflector, and an amazing thing evolved, literally, from trying a billion cycles, a billion different attempts, with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light, from the most angles, over a day, from the sun. And this is the shape that evolved. Its this non tracking collector with these six tuba like horns, and each of them collect light in the following way, if the sunlight strikes right here, it might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly, but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side, it might hit two places and take two bounces. So for direct light, it takes only one bounce, for off axis light it might take two, and for extreme off axis, it might take three. Your efficiency goes down with more bounces, because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce, but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle. So, about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component. Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though. On an average adjusted day, a solar cell, because the suns moving across the sky, the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angles. It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day. So even this, although it was great with no moving parts, we could achieve high temperatures, wasnt enough. We needed to beat solar cells. So we took a look at another idea. We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track. So what you see here is 12 separate petals that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar. You can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now. And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes, for a dollar. So we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more, but only move the petals. The whole system would have a much lower profile, but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day. Now that we have concentrated sunlight, what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity. So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity, And one of the great ones of all time, James Watts steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough. James Watt didnt actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it. But his refinements were incredible. He added new linear motion guides to the pistons, he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder, he made the engine double acting, so it had double the power. Those were major breakthroughs. All of the improvements he made, and its justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt, today is named after him. So we looked at this engine, and this had some potential. Steam engines are dangerous, and they had tremendous impact on the world, industrial revolution and ships and locomotives. But theyre usually good to be large, so theyre not good for distributed power generation. Theyre also very high pressure, so theyre dangerous. Another type of engine is the hot air engine. And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling, but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it. This engine, because it was so interesting, it only worked on air, no steam, has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle. But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didnt invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it. He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up. You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space, and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications. So, once you have mobility, youre making a lot of engines because youve got lots of units, as opposed to steam ships or big factories, so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didnt. So, because it went into mass production, costs were reduced, 100 years of refinement, emissions were reduced, tremendous production value. There have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built, compared to thousands of Stirling engines built. And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore, only large ones for big operations. So after looking at these three, and 47 others, we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use. I want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works. So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical, weight no longer mattered for our application. The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered, because you were moving around. But if youre trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesnt matter so much. We also discovered that efficiency doesnt matter so much if your energy source is free. Normally, efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine. But if your fuel source is free, then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine. So you dont want to optimize for efficiency, you want to optimize for power per dollar. So using that new twist, with the new criteria, we thought we could relook at the Stirling engine, and also bring genetic algorithms in. Basically, Robert Stirling didnt have Gordon Moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power. So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator, which didnt work out for us, to optimize the Stirling engine, and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar, irrespective of weight, irrespective of size, just to get the most conversion of solar energy, because the sun is free. And thats the process we took, let me show you how the engine works. The simplest heat engine, or hot air engine, of all time would be this, take a box, a steel canister, with a piston. Put a flame under it, the piston moves up. Take it off the flame and pour water on it, or let it cool down, the piston moves down. Thats a heat engine. Thats the most fundamental heat engine you could have. The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent, because youre heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time. And youre only getting power from the air thats heating at the same time, but youre wasting energy heating and cooling the metal. So someone came up with a very clever idea. Instead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder, what about if you put a displacer inside, a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth. You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now youre only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end. So, now youre not alternately heating and cooling the metal, just the air. That allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent. And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea, which was, well, Im still not heating the metal now, with this kind of engine, but Im still reheating all the air. Im still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time. What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle, in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold. So he made fine wires, and cracked glass, and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge. So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end, it puts some heat into the sponge. And then when the air comes back after its been cooled, it picks up that heat again. So youre reusing your energy five or six times, and that brings the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent. Its a little known, but brilliant, genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical, like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school, to very potentially possible, once you get the efficiency up, if you can design this to be low enough cost. So we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible. We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works. We applied the genetic algorithm. We got the results from that for the optimal engine. We built engines, so we built 100 different engines over the last two years. We measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured, and then we led that to the current prototype. It led to a very compact, inexpensive engine, and this is what the engine looks like. Let me show you what it looks like in real life. So this is the engine. Its just a small cylinder down here, which holds the generator inside and all the linkage, and its the hot cap, the hot cylinder on the top, this part gets hot, this part is cool, and electricity comes out. The exact converse is also true. If you put electricity in, this will get hot and this will get cold, you get refrigeration. So its a complete reversible cycle, a very efficient cycle, and quite a simple thing to make. So now you put the two things together. So you have the engine. What if you combine the petals and the engine in the center. The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight, takes that heat and turns it into electricity. This is what the first prototype of our system looked like with the petals and the engine in the center. This is being run out in the sun, and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like. Thank you. So this is a unit with the 12 petals. These petals cost about a dollar each, theyre lightweight, injection molded plastic, aluminized. The mechanism to control each petal is below there, with a microprocessor on each one. There are thermocouples on the engine, little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them. Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it. When the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun, find it by searching for the highest temperature. About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day, six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky. A critical part that we can take advantage of is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors and each of these petals is autonomous, and each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup. So you dont have to tell what latitude, longitude youre at, what your roof slope angle is, or what orientation. It doesnt really care. What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot, it searches again a half an hour later, a day later, a month later. It basically figures out where on Earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves, so you dont have to actually enter anything about that. The way the unit works is, when the sun comes out, the engine will start and you get power out here. We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC, so that could be used for certain applications. We have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts AC. And you also get hot water. The hot waters optional. You dont have to use it, it will cool itself. But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that youd normally be rejecting, you can now use as useful energy, whether its for a pool or hot water. Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running. This is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking. And what they do is step, very coarsely at first, and very finely afterward. Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun, they slow down and do a fine search. Then the petals will move into position, and the engine will start. Weve been working on this for the last two years. Were very excited about the progress, we have a long way to go though. This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation, youd probably have more than one unit on your roof. It could be on your roof, your backyard, or somewhere else. You dont have to have enough units to power your entire house, you just save money with each incremental one you add. So youre still using the grid potentially, in this type of application, to be your backup supply, of course, you cant use these at night, and you cant use these on cloudy days. But by reducing your energy use, pretty much at the peak times, usually when you have your air conditioning on, or other times like that, this generates the peak power at the peak usage time, so its very complementary in that sense. This is how we would envision a residential application. We also think theres very big potential for energy farms, especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun. Its a really good combination of those two factors. It turns out theres a lot of powerful sun all around the world, obviously, but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power. So an example of that is, heres the map of the United States. Pretty much everywhere thats not green or blue is a really ideal place, but even the green or blue areas are good, just not as good as the places that are red, orange and yellow. But the hot spot right around Las Vegas and Death Valley is very good. And is only affects the payback period, it doesnt mean that you couldnt use solar energy, you could use it anywhere on Earth. It just affects the payback period if youre comparing to grid supplied electricity. But if you dont have grid supplied electricity, then the question of payback is a different one entirely. Its just how many watts do you get per dollar, and how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way. This is the map of the whole Earth, and you can see a huge swathe in the middle where a large part of the population is, theres tremendous chances for solar energy. And of course, look at Africa. The potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable, and Im really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that. So, in conclusion, I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light, and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists. We believe were getting very close to something practical and affordable. Our short term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer term goal is to be less than a five year payback. And at less than a five year payback, this becomes very economic. So you dont have to just have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. It just makes economic sense. Right now, solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years. If you get it down below five years, then its almost a no brainer because the interest to own it, someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one. So thats our real powerful goal that were really shooting for in the company. Two other things that I learned that were very surprising to me, one was how casual we are about energy. I was walking from the elevator over here, and even just looking at the stage right now, so theres probably 20,500 watt lights right now. Theres 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage, one horsepower is 746 watts, at full power. So theres basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit. Not to mention the 200 horses that are probably running right now to keep the air conditioning going. And its just amazing, walk in the elevator, and theres lights on in the elevator. Of course, now Im very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake. But, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because its so cheap. And its cheap because weve been subsidized by energy thats been concentrated by the sun. Basically, oil is solar energy concentrate. Its been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. And we dont have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are, I think. And it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable, where as were using the energy, were creating it at the same pace, and I really hope we can get there. Thank you very much, youve been a great audience."
"The world is awash with divisive arguments, conflict, fake news, victimhood, exploitation, prejudice, bigotry, blame, shouting and minuscule attention spans. It can sometimes seem that we are doomed to take sides, be stuck in echo chambers and never agree again. It can sometimes seem like a race to the bottom, where everyone is calling out somebody elses privilege and vying to show that they are the most hard done by person in the conversation. How can we make sense in a world that doesnt. I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours, a tool that you might not expect, abstract mathematics. I am a pure mathematician. Traditionally, pure maths is like the theory of maths, where applied maths is applied to real problems like building bridges and flying planes and controlling traffic flow. But Im going to talk about a way that pure maths applies directly to our daily lives as a way of thinking. I dont solve quadratic equations to help me with my daily life, but I do use mathematical thinking to help me understand arguments and to empathize with other people. And so pure maths helps me with the entire human world. But before I talk about the entire human world, I need to talk about something that you might think of as irrelevant schools maths, factors of numbers. Were going to start by thinking about the factors of 30. Now, if this makes you shudder with bad memories of school maths lessons, I sympathize, because I found school maths lessons boring, too. But Im pretty sure we are going to take this in a direction that is very different from what happened at school. So what are the factors of 30. Well, theyre the numbers that go into 30. Maybe you can remember them. Well work them out. Its one, two, three, five, six, 10, 15 and 30. Its not very interesting. Its a bunch of numbers in a straight line. We can make it more interesting by thinking about which of these numbers are also factors of each other and drawing a picture, a bit like a family tree, to show those relationships. So 30 is going to be at the top like a kind of great grandparent. Six, 10 and 15 go into 30. Five goes into 10 and 15. Two goes into six and 10. Three goes into six and 15. And one goes into two, three and five. So now we see that 10 is not divisible by three, but that this is the corners of a cube, which is, I think, a bit more interesting than a bunch of numbers in a straight line. We can see something more here. Theres a hierarchy going on. At the bottom level is the number one, then theres the numbers two, three and five, and nothing goes into those except one and themselves. You might remember this means theyre prime. At the next level up, we have six, 10 and 15, and each of those is a product of two prime factors. So six is two times three, 10 is two times five, 15 is three times five. And then at the top, we have 30, which is a product of three prime numbers, two times three times five. So I could redraw this diagram using those numbers instead. We see that weve got two, three and five at the top, we have pairs of numbers at the next level, and we have single elements at the next level and then the empty set at the bottom. And each of those arrows shows losing one of your numbers in the set. Now maybe it can be clear that it doesnt really matter what those numbers are. In fact, it doesnt matter what they are. So we could replace them with something like A, B and C instead, and we get the same picture. So now this has become very abstract. The numbers have turned into letters. But there is a point to this abstraction, which is that it now suddenly becomes very widely applicable, because A, B and C could be anything. For example, they could be three types of privilege, rich, white and male. So then at the next level, we have rich white people. Here we have rich male people. Here we have white male people. Then we have rich, white and male. And finally, people with none of those types of privilege. And Im going to put back in the rest of the adjectives for emphasis. So here we have rich, white non male people, to remind us that there are nonbinary people we need to include. Here we have rich, nonwhite male people. Here we have non rich, white male people, rich, nonwhite, non male, non rich, white, non male and non rich, nonwhite, male. And at the bottom, with the least privilege, non rich, nonwhite, non male people. We have gone from a diagram of factors of 30 to a diagram of interaction of different types of privilege. And there are many things we can learn from this diagram, I think. The first is that each arrow represents a direct loss of one type of privilege. Sometimes people mistakenly think that white privilege means all white people are better off than all nonwhite people. Some people point at superrich black sports stars and say, See. Theyre really rich. White privilege doesnt exist. But thats not what the theory of white privilege says. It says that if that superrich sports star had all the same characteristics but they were also white, we would expect them to be better off in society. There is something else we can understand from this diagram if we look along a row. If we look along the second to top row, where people have two types of privilege, we might be able to see that theyre not all particularly equal. For example, rich white women are probably much better off in society than poor white men, and rich black men are probably somewhere in between. So its really more skewed like this, and the same on the bottom level. But we can actually take it further and look at the interactions between those two middle levels. Because rich, nonwhite non men might well be better off in society than poor white men. Think about some extreme examples, like Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey. Theyre definitely better off than poor, white, unemployed homeless men. So actually, the diagram is more skewed like this. And that tension exists between the layers of privilege in the diagram and the absolute privilege that people experience in society. And this has helped me to understand why some poor white men are so angry in society at the moment. Because they are considered to be high up in this cuboid of privilege, but in terms of absolute privilege, they dont actually feel the effect of it. And I believe that understanding the root of that anger is much more productive than just being angry at them in return. Seeing these abstract structures can also help us switch contexts and see that different people are at the top in different contexts. In our original diagram, rich white men were at the top, but if we restricted our attention to non men, we would see that they are here, and now the rich, white non men are at the top. So we could move to a whole context of women, and our three types of privilege could now be rich, white and cisgendered. Remember that cisgendered means that your gender identity does match the gender you were assigned at birth. So now we see that rich, white cis women occupy the analogous situation that rich white men did in broader society. And this has helped me understand why there is so much anger towards rich white women, especially in some parts of the feminist movement at the moment, because perhaps theyre prone to seeing themselves as underprivileged relative to white men, and they forget how overprivileged they are relative to nonwhite women. We can all use these abstract structures to help us pivot between situations in which we are more privileged and less privileged. We are all more privileged than somebody and less privileged than somebody else. For example, I know and I feel that as an Asian person, I am less privileged than white people because of white privilege. But I also understand that I am probably among the most privileged of nonwhite people, and this helps me pivot between those two contexts. And in terms of wealth, I dont think Im super rich. Im not as rich as the kind of people who dont have to work. But I am doing fine, and thats a much better situation to be in than people who are really struggling, maybe are unemployed or working at minimum wage. I perform these pivots in my head to help me understand experiences from other peoples points of view, which brings me to this possibly surprising conclusion, that abstract mathematics is highly relevant to our daily lives and can even help us to understand and empathize with other people. My wish is that everybody would try to understand other people more and work with them together, rather than competing with them and trying to show that theyre wrong. And I believe that abstract mathematical thinking can help us achieve that. Thank you. "
"Theres an African proverb that goes, The lions story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it. More than a racial conversation, we need a racial literacy to decode the politics of racial threat in America. Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth, that the more we understand that our cultural differences represent the power to heal the centuries of racial discrimination, dehumanization and illness. Both of my parents were African American. My father was born in Southern Delaware, my mother, North Philadelphia, and these two places are as different from each other as east is from west, as New York City is from Montgomery, Alabama. My fathers way of dealing with racial conflict was to have my brother Bryan, my sister Christy and I in church what seemed like 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If anybody bothered us because of the color of our skin, he believed that you should pray for them, knowing that God would get them back in the end. You could say that his racial coping approach was spiritual, for later on, one day, like Martin Luther King. My mothers coping approach was a little different. She was, uh, you could say, more relational, right now, like, in your face, right now. More like Malcolm X. She was raised from neighborhoods in which there was racial violence and segregation, where she was chased out of neighborhoods, and she exacted violence to chase others out of hers. When she came to Southern Delaware, she thought she had come to a foreign country. She didnt understand anybody, particularly the few black and brown folks who were physically deferential and verbally deferential in the presence of whites. Not my mother. When she wanted to go somewhere, she walked. She didnt care what you thought. And she pissed a lot of people off with her cultural style. Before we get into the supermarket, she would give us the talk, Dont ask for nothin, dont touch nothin. Do you understand what Im saying to you. I dont care if all the other children are climbing the walls. Theyre not my children. Do you understand what Im saying to you. In three part harmony, Yes, Mom. Before wed get into the supermarket, that talk was all we needed. Now, how many of you ever got that talk. How many of you ever give that talk. How many of you ever give that talk today. My mother didnt give us the talk because she was worried about money or reputation or us misbehaving. We never misbehaved. We were too scared. We were in church 24 hours a day, seven days a week. She gave us that talk to remind us that some people in the world would interpret us as misbehaving just by being black. Not every parent has to worry about their children being misjudged because of the color of their skin, just by breathing. So we get into the supermarket, and people look at us, stare at us as if we just stole something. Every now and then, a salesperson would do something or say something because they were pissed with our cultural style, and it would usually happen at the conveyor belt. And the worst thing they could do was to throw our food into the bag. And when that happened, it was on. My mother began to tell them who they were, who their family was, where to go, how fast to get there. If you havent been cursed out by my mother, you havent lived. The person would be on the floor, writhing in utter decay and decomposition, whimpering in a pool of racial shame. Now, both my parents were Christians. The difference is my father prayed before a racial conflict and my mother prayed after. There is a time, if you use both of their strategies, if you use them in the right time and the right way. But its never a time, theres a time for conciliation, theres a time for confrontation, but its never a time to freeze up like a deer in the headlights, and its never a time to lash out in heedless, thoughtless anger. The lesson in this is that when it comes to race relations, sometimes, weve got to know how to pray, think through, process, prepare. And other times, weve got to know how to push, how to do something. And Im afraid that neither of these two skills, preparing, pushing, are prevalent in our society today. If you look at the neuroscience research which says that when we are racially threatened, our brains go on lockdown, and we dehumanize black and brown people. Our brains imagine that children and adults are older than they really are, larger than they really are and closer than they really are. When were at our worst, we convince ourselves that they dont deserve affection or protection. At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we know that some of the scariest moments are racial encounters, some of the scariest moments that people will ever face. If you look at the police encounters that have led to some wrongful deaths of mostly Native Americans and African Americans in this country, theyve lasted about two minutes. Within 60 seconds, our brains go on lockdown. And when were unprepared, we overreact. At best, we shut down. At worst, we shoot first and ask no questions. Imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat within those 60 seconds and keep our brains from going on lockdown. Imagine how many children would get to come home from school or 7 Eleven without getting expelled or shot. Imagine how many mothers and fathers wouldnt have to cry. Racial socialization can help young people negotiate 60 second encounters, but its going to take more than a chat. It requires a racial literacy. Now, how do parents have these conversations, and what is a racial literacy. Thank you for asking. A racial literacy involves the ability to read, recast and resolve a racially stressful encounter. Reading involves recognizing when a racial moment happens and noticing our stress reactions to it. Recasting involves taking mindfulness and reducing my tsunami interpretation of this moment and reducing it to a mountain climbing experience, one that is, from impossible situation to one that is much more doable and challenging. Resolving a racially stressful encounter involves being able to make a healthy decision that is not an underreaction, where I pretend, That didnt bother me, or an overreaction, where I exaggerate the moment. Now, we can teach parents and children how to read, recast and resolve using a mindfulness strategy we call, Calculate, locate, communicate, breathe and exhale. Stay with me. Calculate asks, What feeling am I having right now, and how intense is it on a scale of one to 10. Locate asks, Where in my body do I feel it. And be specific, like the Native American girl at a Chicago fifth grade school said to me, I feel angry at a nine because Im the only Native American. And I can feel it in my stomach, like a bunch of butterflies are fighting with each other, so much so that they fly up into my throat and choke me. The more detailed you can be, the easier it is to reduce that spot. Communicate asks, What self talk and what images are coming in my mind. And if you really want help, try breathing in and exhaling slowly. With the help of my many colleagues at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we use in the moment stress reduction in several research and therapy projects. One project is where we use basketball to help youth manage their emotions during 60 second eruptions on the court. Another project, with the help of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott, we leverage the cultural style of African American barbershops, where we train black barbers to be health educators in two areas, one, to safely reduce the sexual risk in their partner relationships, and the other, to stop retaliation violence. The cool part is the barbers use their cultural style to deliver this health education to 18 to 24 year old men while theyre cutting their hair. Another project is where we teach teachers how to read, recast and resolve stressful moments in the classroom. And a final project, in which we teach parents and their children separately to understand their racial traumas before we bring them together to problem solve daily microaggressions. Now, racially literate conversations with our children can be healing, but it takes practice. And I know some of you are saying, Practice. Practice. Were talking about practice. Yes, we are talking about practice. I have two sons. My oldest, Bryan, is 26, and my youngest, Julian, is 12. And we do not have time to talk about how that happened. But, when I think of them, they are still babies to me, and I worry every day that the world will misjudge them. In August of 2013, Julian, who was eight at the time, and I were folding laundry, which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence, I should have known something strange was going to happen. On the TV were Trayvon Martins parents, and they were crying because of the acquittal of George Zimmerman. And Julian was glued to the TV. He had a thousand questions, and I was not prepared. He wanted to know why. Why would a grown man stalk and hunt down and kill an unarmed 17 year old boy. And I did not know what to say. The best thing that could come out of my mouth was, Julian, sometimes in this world, there are people who look down on black and brown people and do not treat them, and children, too, do not treat them as human. He interpreted the whole situation as sad. Thats sad. We dont care. Youre not our kind. Yes. Its like, Were better than you. Yes. And theres nothing you can do about that. And if you scare me, or something like that, I will shoot you because Im scared of you. Exactly. But if somebodys stalking you, Its not the same for everyone else. Its not always the same, no. Youve got to be careful. Yeah, because people can disrespect you. Exactly. And think that youre, You dont look, you dont look like youre ... Its like theyre saying that You dont look right, so I guess I have the right to disrespect you. Yeah, and thats what we call, we call that racism. And we call that racism, Julian, and yes, some people, other people, can wear a hoodie, and nothing happens to them. But you and Trayvon might, and thats why Daddy wants you to be safe. And thats why, So you mean like, when you said other people, you mean, like if Trayvon was a white, um, that he wouldnt be disrespected like that. Yes, Julian, Daddy meant white people when I said, other people, all right. So there was a way in which I was so awkward in the beginning, but once I started getting my rhythm and my groove, I started talking about stereotypes and issues of discrimination, and just when I was getting my groove on, Julian interrupted me. ... dangerous, or youre a criminal because youre black, and youre a child or a boy, That is wrong, it doesnt matter who does it. Dad, I need to stop you there. What. Remember when we were ... So he interrupts me to tell me a story about when he was racially threatened at a swimming pool with a friend by two grown white men, which his mother confirmed. And I felt happy that he was able to talk about it, it felt like he was getting it. We moved from the sadness of Trayvons parents and started talking about George Zimmermans parents, which, I read in a magazine, condoned the stalking of Trayvon. And Julians reaction to me was priceless. It made me feel like he was getting it. What did they say about him. Well, I think they basically felt that he was justified to follow and stalk, What the, . Yeah, I think thats wrong. Thats, one minute. So theyre saying he has the right to follow a black kid, get in a fight with him and shoot him. As Julian was getting it, I started to lose it. Because in my minds eye, I was thinking. What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon. I calculated my anger at a 10. I found, located, my right leg was shaking uncontrollably like I was running. And in my minds eye, I could see somebody chasing Julian, and I was chasing them. And the only thing that could come out of my mouth was if anybody tries to bother my child ... If anybody tries to bother my child ... mmm, mmm, mmm. What will happen. Well, they better run. Because what. Im gonna get em. See. Im gonna get em. Really. Oh, yeah. Then theyre gonna get you because they might have weapons. Well, you know what, Im gonna call police, too, like I should. But I feel like I wanna get em. But you cant, youre right, you cant just go chasing people. They can be armed. Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right. I feel like I wanna chase em. Plus they could be an army or something. I know, I feel like I wanna go get em, messing with my son. I dont like that. Um ... But you right. You gotta be careful. And um, you gotta be careful. You never know what some crazy people will think about you. Just as long as you believe youre beautiful like Daddy believes youre beautiful and handsome, and Mommy believes youre beautiful and handsome and smart. And you deserve to be on this planet, just as happy and beautiful and smart as you want to be. You can do anything you want, baby. Racial socialization is not just what parents teach their children. Its also how children respond to what their parents teach. Is my child prepared. Can they recognize when a racial elephant shows up in a room. Can they reduce their tsunami interpretation down to a mountain climbing adventure that they can engage and not run away. Can they make a healthy and just decision in 60 seconds. Can I. Can you. Yes, we can. We can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate, locate communicate, breathe and exhale in the middle of our most threatening moments, when we come face to face with our lesser selves. If you take the centuries of racial rage that boils up in all of our bodies, minds and souls, and anything that affects our bodies, minds and souls affects our health, we could probably use gun control for our hearts. I just want what all parents want for their children when were not around, affection and protection. When police and teachers see my children, I want them to imagine their own, because I believe if you see our children as your children, you wont shoot them. With racial literacy, and yes, practice, we can decode the racial trauma from our stories, and our healing will come in the telling. But we must never forget that our cultural differences are full of affection and protection, and remember always that the lions story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it. Thank you very much. "
"I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side. Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this, I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym. But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasnt the only one. Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired. I think theres nothing like a crisis to tell you whats really important and whats not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means. Im a novelist, and Im interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. Theyre both stories, interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but its embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. Its the whole book. Its not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but its because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time, a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and thats why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it, we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future. I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to natures rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need times arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry. What happens when time warps. So many of us today have the sensation that times arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesnt flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether Im in New York or New Delhi. And thats not all. Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with todays friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that Ill call the digital now. Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now. This digital now is not the present, because its always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isnt the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author. Why not buy his book. Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom, but not when its constantly for its own sake. Not just is the digital now far from the present, but its in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you. Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that Im tapped into you in real time. Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water, and those without. There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true. For example, its said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isnt somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction. We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally. Possibly, but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldnt be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. Theyre like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them. By archiving everything, we think that we can store it, but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone weve known for a very long time. At such moments, our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after. I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time cant be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we dont need to let it. We can choose otherwise. Weve seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back. Thank you. "
